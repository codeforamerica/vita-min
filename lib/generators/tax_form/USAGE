Description:
    This will generate the basic, simple skeleton for a controller utilizing a
    questions form. Currently, this is scoped at just the FYST needs.

Example:
    bin/rails generate tax_form az_dependent_care

    This will create:
        app/controllers/state_file/questions/az_dependent_care_controller.rb
        app/views/state_file/questions/az_dependent_care/edit.html.erb
        app/forms/state_file/questions/az_dependent_care_form.rb
        specs/controllers/state_file/questions/az_dependent_care_controller_spec.rb
        specs/forms/state_file/az_dependent_care_form_spec.rb
