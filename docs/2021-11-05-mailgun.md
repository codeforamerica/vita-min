## Mailgun settings and rationale

Date: 2021-11-05

## Summary

For productione email sending, we use a [Mailgun dedicated IP.](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803448249-How-do-I-warm-up-my-IP-)
This means we use it for mg.getctc.org and mg.getyourrefund.org and no other Mailgun domains.

We don't use this for demo or staging so that we can feel good about sending total nonsense
from demo/staging without negatively impacting prod.

At the time of writing, we're using both the shared IP and a dedicated IP. On/around November 12, the warm-up will be
done, and we can migrate fully to the dedicated IP.
