# Deploying `vita-min`

First, we should be aware of the branches and environments, as these
form the basis of what we deploy _from_, and what we deploy _to_.

Also, this project employs a continuous integration and continuous delivery
system (CI/CD).

## Environments

Details about the environments:

- Staging - an experimental environment. Generally up to date
  with the `main` branch, as it is deployed whenever `main` is
  updated on GitHub, provided the test suite passes.
- Demo - a quality check and demonstration environment. Like Staging,
  it remains up to date with `main` thanks to continuous deployment.
  Unlike Stating, it is rarely used for experimentation.
- Production - the public, visible environment. The Production environment
  is the deploy target of the `release` branch. Like other environments,
  the deployment is performed automatically.

## Branches

- `main` - this is the central trunk of `vita-min` development. This branch
  contains the most up-to-date code, merged in from various work branches. The
  `main` branch is deployed to the Demo and Staging environments
  automatically.
- `release` - this branch represents the code currently in the Production
  environment. It tends to lag behind `main` by a few commits. The `release`
  branch is deployed to the Production environment automatically.
- work branches - most development occurs in a work branch. These branches form
  the sources for Pull Requests on GitHub, and a place to work without
  disrupting the `main` branch.

## How to Deploy

## To the Staging and Demo Environments

To deploy to Demo and Staging, commit/merge to `main` and push to
Github. This will trigger a CI/CD build and deploy to both the Demo and Staging
environments.

### Deploying to Staging Directly

TODO: elaborate on this process, with instructions on force-pushing and
recovery.

At times, you will want to push code to Demo or Staging without going
through the automated deploy process. Manual deployment should be limited
to situations where a temporary solution is called for.

Good candidates:

- pushing a spike for review by stakeholders
- manually testing internals or integration with a 3rd party (e.g. Sentry)

## To The Production Environment

To deploy to Production, run the `bin/release` script from the project root. In
most cases, you will want to run this from the `main` branch. It can be run
from a different branch, however this may complicate subsequent releases
_unless_ the `release` branch is merged back into `main` after the fact.

This script will undertake all the necessary steps for a deployment. If there is
a merge conflict when merging `main` into `release`, the conflicts must be
resolved by hand, then re-run `bin/release`.

The script also creates a tag. For regular releases, we use `version-N.N.N`,
incrementing the appropriate number. Please consult
[semver.org](https://semver.org) for advice on semantic versioning.

The steps the `bin/release` script automates are as follows:

1. fetches from origin
2. prompts for new tag name
3. opens editor with template, includes list of changes
4. merges current branch (usually `main`) into `release`
5. creates tag and GitHub release using `hub` tool

After this, CircleCI runs and deploys if the tests pass.

### Releasing without `bin/release`

To issue a release without using the script, follow the steps listed above:

1. `git pull` the main and release branches
2. from the `release` branch, `git merge --ff main`
3. `git tag <version name>` with the next version
4. `git push && git push --tags`

To issue a release from Github, use the same naming convention,
but begin by clicking the 'releases' button on the main page.
Github provides useful documentation [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

### Hotfixing

It may be necessary to issue a hotfix in some circumstances. This can be
accomplished a couple of ways. Note that a subsequent release may have merging
issues that have to be resolved manually. Merging from `release` into `main`
helps resolve conflicts pre-emptively.

#### Work on the `release` Branch

You can check out and work directly on the `release` branch, performing a `push`
when complete. You should immediately merge `release` into `main`.

#### Work on a Hotfix Branch

Create a hotfix branch directly from `release` (rather than `main`) if a PR is
recommended. When creating the PR, set the PR to target `release` rather than
`main`. When reviewed and merged, merge `release` back into `main`.

## Other Release-related Tools

To view a detailed list of releases, visit https://github.com/codeforamerica/vita-min/releases

To view a list of tags (with the highest releases at the top):

`git tag | sort --version-sort -r`

To view a list of releases with their SHAs (latest first):

`bin/show-tags`

To tag a release:

`git tag version-N.N.N`

Once a release has been tagged, you'll want to push the tag to GitHub:

`git push --tags`
