      nj_minimal_essential_health_coverage_html: |-
        <p>Most people who have health insurance have minimum essential coverage. "Minimal essential coverage" just refers to how much your plan covers. If you have any of the following, you most likely have it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A plan through your employer</li>
          <li>A plan bought through <a href="https://nj.gov/getcoverednj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GetCoveredNJ</a></li>
          <li>Medicare</li>
          <li>Medicaid (NJ FamilyCare)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://nj.gov/treasury/njhealthinsurancemandate/getinfo.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Here is the full list of insurance options that have minimum essential coverage.</a></p>
        <p>If you only had standalone vision and dental plans, workers' compensation coverage, and/or coverage limited to a specified disease or illness, you didnâ€™t have minimum essential coverage. In New Jersey, as of 2018, you need minimum essential coverage, or you may have to pay additional taxes.</p>
