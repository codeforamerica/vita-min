              <p>Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined a copy of my electronic Arizona individual income tax return and accompanying schedules and statements for the year ending December 31, %{filing_year}, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and complete.</p>
              <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li><em>If I am owed a refund and I provided direct deposit information,</em> I consent that my refund be directly deposited as designated in the electronic portion of my %{filing_year} Arizona individual income tax return. If I have filed a joint return, this is an irrevocable appointment of the other spouse as an agent to receive the refund.</li>
                <li><em>If I am not owed a refund or if I elected to receive my refund via mailed check,</em> I do not want direct deposit of my refund or I am not receiving a refund.</li>
                <li><em>If I owe tax and I provided direct debit information,</em> I authorize the Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) and its designated Financial Agent to initiate an ACH electronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) entry to the financial institution account indicated in the tax preparation software for payment of my Arizona taxes owed on this return. I also authorize the financial institutions involved in the processing of the electronic payment of taxes to receive confidential information necessary to answer inquiries and resolve issues related to the payment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If I have filed a balance due return, I understand that if the ADOR does not receive full and timely payment of my tax liability by April 15, 2024, I will remain liable for the tax liability and all applicable interest and penalties.</p>
              <p>I consent to my Electronic Return Originator (ERO) or On-Line Service Provider (OLSP) sending my electronic Arizona individual income tax return and accompanying schedules and statements to ADOR, and I consent to my ERO or OLSP sending such information to ADOR through a transmitter. I consent to ADOR sending my ERO, OLSP and/or transmitter an acknowledgement of receipt of transmission and an indication of whether or not the transmission of my return is accepted and, if the return is rejected, the reason(s) for the rejection. If the processing of my return or refund is delayed, I authorize ADOR to disclose to my ERO, OLSP and/ or transmitter the reason(s) for the delay, or when the refund was sent. If ADOR contacts my ERO for a copy of my return, any documents or schedules to my return, and/or this authorization form, I authorize my ERO to release copies of the requested documents to ADOR.</p>
              <p>By using a computer system and software to prepare and/or file my tax return(s) electronically, I consent to the transmission of my return(s) and to the disclosure of all information about my use of the system and software to the Arizona State Tax Commission.</p>
              <p>I declare under penalties of perjury that to the best of my knowledge and belief the return is true, correct and complete.</p>

              <p>By checking the box(es) shown below, and pressing “Submit,” I understand and agree that I am submitting for filing my 2023 New York State (NYS) electronic personal income tax return. I declare, under penalty of perjury, that I have examined the information on my NYS electronic tax return, including all information transferred to my NYS return from my federal return, and all accompanying schedules, attachments, and statements provided with the return, and certify that my NYS electronic return is true, correct, and complete. By executing Form TR-579-IT and providing it to the ERO, I have authorized the ERO (Code for America) to file my 2023 NYS electronic tax return with the NYS Tax Department through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Modernized e-File System.</p>
              <p>In addition, I understand and agree that by using a computer system and software to prepare and transmit my tax return electronically, I have consented to the disclosure to NYS of all information pertaining to the transmission of my NYS tax return electronically. If I am paying my New York State personal income taxes owed or receiving a tax refund by electronic funds transfer, I certify that the account holder authorizes the NYS Tax Department and its designated financial agents to initiate an electronic funds transfer from the financial institution account indicated on the 2023 NYS electronic return, and authorizes the financial institution to debit the amount from that account (if tax is owed) or credit the account with a direct deposit (where a refund is due).</p>
              <p>As New York does not support International ACH Transactions (IAT), I attest the source for these funds is within the United States. I understand and agree that I may revoke this authorization for payment only by contacting the Tax Department no later than two (2) business days prior to the payment date.</p>
