                  There are several commercial tax preparation services that offer state-only tax filing. Here are a few tips and tricks when choosing an option:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Since you've already submitted your federal tax return, make sure the service or software you use allows you to file a state-only tax return. You may need to reach out to their customer support to confirm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You'll be asked to reenter or provide the same information you reported on your federal return. This information is needed to complete parts of your state return.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When you file, make sure you only submit your state tax return. If you submit your federal return again, your federal return may be rejected.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                Fees may apply.

              list3: When filing, only submit your state return. If you submit your federal return again, your federal return may be rejected.

                  Certified tax preparers at Simplify CT can help prepare and e-file your state tax return for free over the course of about 2-3 weeks.

                <p>
                  The process:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      You complete a short form to request state-only assistance. (You will get an automated email confirming you submitted the form.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A certified tax preparer will share a link to securely upload your federal tax form (1040), tax documents, and ID.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They will give you a call to ask for additional information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once your return is ready, they'll schedule a call to review and answer any of your questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You'll sign your state tax form online.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The tax preparer will e-file your state taxes.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
