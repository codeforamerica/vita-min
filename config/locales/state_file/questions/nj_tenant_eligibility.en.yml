            <p>Most rentals are. The building owner pays the tax. There are some types of housing that might not be taxed:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A tax-exempt property, e.g. subsidized and campus housing, property owned by nonprofit organizations.</li>
              <li>A residence on which Payments-In-Lieu-of-Tax (P.I.L.O.T) payments were made. (If you think your building may have been subject to P.I.L.O.T payments, you can contact your building owner or the municipal tax office to confirm.)</li>
            </ul>
