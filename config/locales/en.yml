          - Like the IRS non-filer sign up tool, GetCTC helps you e-file a simplified %{current_tax_year} tax return. If you've already filed a %{current_tax_year} return, the IRS will reject this return without reviewing it, even if your first return was wrong or processed incorrectly.
          - If the information on your %{current_tax_year} return has changed and you want to update your CTC payments, you can use the IRS's <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CTC Update Portal</a>.
          - If you think your %{current_tax_year} return was never processed and you don't know what happened, you'll need direct assistance to help resolve your case. You can reach out to a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) site or the Taxpayer Advocate Service.
          title: Unfortunately, you can't use GetCTC.

          how_do_i_get_an_itin:
            answer_html: |
              If your children have social security number(s) but you do not, then you can use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) in order to claim the Child Tax Credit.
              <br/><br/>
              To apply for an ITIN, you must submit <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7'>Form W-7</a> to the IRS along with the required identity verification (like a passport, driver's license, or birth certificate). You can see a full list of identity verification document options listed <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw7'>here</a> under “Supporting Documentation”.
              <br/><br/>
              You can submit your W-7 and identity verification documents through the mail (using the address shown on Form W-7), in person at an <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office'>IRS office</a>, or through a <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/acceptance-agent-program'>Certified Acceptance Agent</a>.
            question: How do I get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) if I do not have a Social Security Number?
          how_do_i_know_what_i_received_for_the_stimulus:
            answer_html: |
              In order to claim the Child Tax Credit, you will need to report the amount you may be missing in stimulus payments (Economic Impact Payments).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>first stimulus payment</b> was sent in April 2020 and was $1,200 per adult tax filer plus $500 per dependent under 17 years old (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $2,200).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>second stimulus payment</b> was sent in December 2020 and was $600 per adult tax filer plus $600 per dependent (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $1,800).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>third stimulus payment</b> was sent in April 2021 and was $1,400 per adult tax filer plus $1,400 per dependent of any age (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $4,200).
            question: How do I know what I received for the stimulus (Economic Impact Payments)?
          no_income_or_income_from_benefits_programs:
            answer_html: |
              There is no minimum income required to get the Child Tax Credit for tax year 2021. Even if your family has $0 in reported income and didn’t work during the previous year, you can still be eligible for the full Child Tax Credit as long as you have a child who has a Social Security Number and was younger than 17 at the end of 2020.
              <br/><br/>
              If your only income was from benefits programs, we recommend that you use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal to receive cash benefits for your family.
              <br/><br/>
              If you earned income from a benefits program and also some income from working, you have the option to file a full tax return in order to receive the additional benefits that you may qualify for.
            question: What if I don’t have any income, or only income from benefits programs (like SSI, SNAP, TANF, or WIC)?
          parents_with_shared_custody:
            answer_html: |
              If you are married and signing up for the Child Tax Credit jointly with your spouse, you will receive one monthly payment per child, as a family.
              <br/><br/>
              If you file separately from any other caretakers for your child, then only one person can sign up to receive the Child Tax Credit.
            question: Can parents who share custody of a child both get the Child Tax Credit?

            answer_html: |
              If the IRS thinks your family is eligible for the Child Tax Credit and already has the information it needs to pay you automatically, you should have received a postcard or letter from the IRS in June 2021.
              <br/><br/>
              If you have already filed taxes for tax years 2019 or 2020, you will begin receiving your payments automatically on July 15, 2021, and then on or about the 15th of each month for the next 6 months.
              <br/><br/>
              If you have not filed taxes in the past two years and need to submit information to claim the Child Tax Credit, you can use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal.
              <br/><br/>
              If you need to update your address or banking information with the IRS you can use the <strong><a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal'>CTC Update Portal (CTC UP)</a></strong> ahead of your August payment. Coming soon: at a later date, the update portal will give you the ability to update your household information.
            question: What will happen and when?
          what_will_i_need_to_submit:
            answer_html: |
              Signing up for the Child Tax Credit is simple: you only need a working email address or phone number and the social security numbers of any children you want to claim.<br/><br/>
              Children claimed for the Child Tax Credit must have a valid Social security number (SSN), however the tax filer (a parent, grandparent, or guardian) can have either a SSN or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).
            question: I don’t usually file taxes, what will I need to submit to sign up for the Child Tax Credit?
          will_i_ever_have_to_pay_this_money_back:
            answer_html: If you receive payments for a child who is no longer your dependent or if your income has drastically changed, you may have to pay that money back, though there are some protections in place for those with incomes below $80,000 (for individuals or non custodial parents), $100,000 (for single, head-of-household), or $120,000 (for filing jointly).
            question: Will I ever have to pay this money back?
          will_it_affect_my_immigration_status:
            answer_html: No, receiving the Child Tax Credit or other tax credits that you are eligible for, will not affect your immigration status, your ability to get a green card, or your future immigration plans. Use of tax credits is not considered in a “public charge” determination by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
            question: Will receiving the Child Tax Credit affect my immigration status or my ability to get a green card?

          already_filed:
            body1: The IRS issued the first two stimulus payments automatically using data from 2019 tax returns, and is issuing the third payment using data from 2019 or 2020 tax returns. If you filed one of these returns, the IRS should have the correct information it needs for you.
            body2: If your family situation changed since 2019 and you didn’t file in 2020, or you think the IRS underpaid your stimulus payments last year, you can use the sign-up tools below to update the IRS and request missing funds.
            subheading: If you already filed a 2019, or a 2020 tax return you don't have to do anything.
          body1: To issue the third stimulus payment, the IRS needs to know current information about you and your children. If you have submitted a 2019 or a 2020 tax return, or if you used the IRS Non-filer Portal in 2020 to claim your stimulus payments, then the IRS has enough information to send your family your third stimulus automatically.
          body2: If you have not submitted any information to the IRS in the last year — or if you need to claim any of the first two stimulus payments — you can submit your information through our simplified filing portal and get your payments.
          heading: How do I get the stimulus payments?
          not_filed:
            body1: If you earned less than $12,400 (or less than $22,800 if you are married), you can use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal to get the stimulus payments, and, if you have kids, the Child Tax Credit as well. (Note, despite the name, you do not need to have children or be claiming the CTC to use GetCTC.)
            body2: To use this tool, you will need to provide the Social Security Numbers or Adoption Taxpayer Identification Numbers of your children. You can sign up for the stimulus payments even if you have little to no income or receive other federal benefits like SSI or SSDI.
            subheading: If you have not filed a tax return, you can sign up to get the stimulus payments.
        qualify:
          body1: You can receive stimulus payments if you have a Social Security Number, even if you make little or no money.
          body2: Generally, the children in your family qualify for the first two stimulus payments too if they are under 18 and live with you most of the year. You can receive the third stimulus payment for any family member who is your dependent, even if they are not a child.
          dependents:
            body: 'Your child qualifies for the first two payments if:'
            qualifiers:
            - The child is your son, daughter, grandchild, stepchild or adopted child; younger sibling, step-sibling, half-sibling, or their descendent; or a foster child placed with you by a government agency.
            - The child was under 17 at the end of 2020.
            - The child has a valid Social Security Number.

            subheading: Does my child or dependent qualify for stimulus payments?
            third_payment: For the third payment, the children described above qualify — plus some other relatives you primarily support who have very low income.
          eligible:
            body: Joint filers making up to $150,000, single head of households making up to $112,500, and other single filers making up to $75,000 qualify for the full amount of the stimulus checks. For the first two payments, you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) must have an SSN or must have served in the military in 2020.
            subheading: Who is eligible to claim stimulus payments?
          heading: Do I qualify for the stimulus payments?
        subheader:
          claim: Claim your missing stimulus payments (and, if you have kids, your Child Tax Credit), even if you don’t have your tax documents.

            <p>Congress passed three rounds of stimulus checks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, December 2020, and March 2021. All together, the payments are worth up to $3,200 per adult and up to $2,500 per child in your family. The payments are formally known as Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), or as the Recovery Rebate Credit (RRC). </p>

            <p>You can act now to get any of the three payments you haven’t yet received. If you have kids, you’ll also be able to sign up for payments of the new Advance Child Tax Credit.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>In order to claim the Child and Dependent Care credit, you must have:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Paid for care in 2021 for a qualifying child under the age of 13, or a spouse or dependent unable to care for themselves.</li>
                <li>Needed this care in order to work or look for work yourself. In a two-parent household, both spouses must have been working or looking for work (or a full-time student).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When filing a tax return, you will need to report the amount you paid, as well as the care provider's name, Employer Identification Number (EIN), and address. If your child care was provided by an individual, you'll need their name, Social Security Number, and address.</p>
              question: How do I get the Child and Dependent Care Credit?
            how_has_the_child_and_dependent_care_credit_changed:
              answer_html: |
                <p>The Child and Dependent Care Credit significantly expanded in 2021 and more families than ever qualify for this tax benefit. The maximum amount of credit increased from $1,050 to $4,000 if you have one qualifying dependent and increased from $2,100 to $8,000 for two or more qualifying dependents.</p>
                <p>The credit is now "refundable," which means that you can get it even if you have very little income and don't owe any taxes.</p>
              question: How has the Child and Dependent Care Credit Changed?
            title: Child and Dependent Care Credit
            what_is_the_child_and_dependent_care_credit:
              answer_html: The Child and Dependent Care Credit is a tax credit that helps families cover expenses for child care needed to work, or to look for work. The credit is also available to families that must pay for the care of a spouse or other adult relative who isn't mentally or physically able to care for themselves. Families can claim up to $4,000 for one child/dependent or $8,000 for two or more children/dependents. For most families, the credit covers half the cost of child care. For example, if you paid $3,000 in child care costs for one child, you could claim $1,500. If you paid $20,000 in care costs for two children, you could claim $8,000. You must report earned income during 2021 to claim the credit.
              question: What is the Child and Dependent Care Credit?
          child_tax_credit:
            am_i_eligible_for_child_tax_credit_if_i_dont:
              answer_html: |
                <p>To be eligible for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), each child claimed must have a Social Security Number (SSN) and each parent must have either a Social Security Number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN).</p>
                <p>If you do not currently have an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN), but want to claim the Child Tax Credit for your children, you can apply for an ITIN with the support of a certified tax preparer using <a href="https://www.getyourrefund.org/en/questions/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourRefund</a>.</p>
              question: Am I eligible for Child Tax Credit if I don’t have a Social Security Number?
            do_i_have_to_report_my_advanced_child_tax_credit:
              answer_html: |
                <p>When you file your 2021 tax return, you will need to report to the IRS how much you received in Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments.</p>
                <p>For most families who received advance payments, this amount will be $1,800 for younger children, or $1,500 for older children. For example, if you have one toddler, you're owed $3,600 in total CTC; if you received $1,800 in advance payments last year, you'll get another $1,800 this year.</p>
                <p>The IRS requires you to report how much you received in monthly payments last year when you file your tax return. The IRS will use this number to calculate how much more CTC money you are owed.</p>
                <p>If you do not remember how much you received in CTC payments you can look at your bank account records, refer to the letter IRS sent you in January with this information, or log into <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/your-online-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your online IRS account</a>.</p>
                <p>If you can not find the exact numbers for the amount of CTC payments you received in 2021, you should report your best guess of how much you received. There is no penalty for reporting the wrong number, but the wrong number may delay the processing of your refund by several months.</p>

                <p>Most families with children under 18 qualify for the Child Tax Credit (CTC). To qualify for CTC:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>To receive the full amount of money, you must earn less than $75,000 as a single parent, or $150,000 as a married couple. If you earn less than $240,000 as a parent, or $440,000 as a married couple, you can still receive some CTC.</li>
                <li>You must have lived in the United States for more than six months in 2021. (If not, you might be eligible for a smaller CTC.)</li>
                <li>The child you are claiming must be your child, your grandchild, your sibling, your niece/nephew or your great-niece/nephew. Foster relatives, step relatives, and half-relatives also qualify.</li>
                <li>Your child needs a Social Security Number (SSN). You, the parent, need an SSN or an Individual TaxPayer Identification Number (ITIN).</li>
                <li>Your child must have been less than 18 at the end of 2021. (Born on or after January 1, 2004.)</li>
                <li>Your child needs to have lived with you for at least six months in 2021.</li>
                <li>Your child must not be financially independent, meaning they can not pay for more than half of their own living expenses.</li>
                <li>You must be the person best situated to claim the child. Generally, parents can claim children before non-parents; parents who spend more time with the child can claim before parents who spend less; and non-parents who spend more time with the child can claim before non-parents who spend less.</li>

                <p>If you received advance monthly payments in 2021 then you can file a tax return to get the rest of your payments (generally, $1,800 per younger child and $1,500 per older child).

                <p>Families who do not usually file taxes are sometimes called "non-filers." Often, this refers to families who make little enough money that they aren't required to file taxes—sometimes because they get their income from disability or other benefits, instead.</p>
                <p>Everyone who is eligible for tax benefits should file a tax return, even if you think of yourself as a "non-filer." Filing a tax return could get you cash benefits like the Child Tax Credit even if you do not normally file a tax return or have not filed a tax return in a long time.</p>
                <p>Families who are not required to file tax returns do have an extra option: they can file a "simplified" tax return. This has sometimes been called the "non-filer form" or "non-filer tool." The simplified return is technically a tax return, but is much easier to finish, and requires much less information. Simplified filing will be available in May 2022. If you are not required to file taxes, you have the option to file a full tax return now or to wait until May to use a simpler filing tool.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>You can file a tax return now to claim the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The CTC for tax year 2021 is up to $3,600 per child under 6, and $3,000 per child age 6-17.</p>
                <p>If you received monthly CTC payments last year you will only get your remaining CTC amount when you file a tax return this year. So, if you have a 2 year old, and you got six months of $300 payments last year, you already received $1,800 of your CTC. When you file in 2022, you will receive the other half—another $1,800.</p>
                <p>There are currently no more monthly payments of the CTC during 2022. When you file, you will receive the remaining amount in one payment.</p>

The letters contain information about how much the IRS issued you in these monthly payments. To claim the rest of the Child Tax Credit this year, you’ll need to report the amount the IRS paid you — so this letter can be very helpful. Letter 6419 was sent in December 2021 or January 2022.

              answer_html: |
                <p>Probably not. </p>
                <p>If you owe back child support, some payments you get from the government can be taken (or "garnished") to pay your child support debt. IRS payments like tax refunds are subject to this process.</p>
                <p>Notably, the CTC monthly payments issued in 2021 were <em>not</em> taken to cover child support debts. Any amount you claim this year, though—whether it is the second half of the credit, or the whole credit—can be taken.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>Monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) started in July 2021 based on a law Congress passed earlier in the year, which made significant expansions to the CTC. Unfortunately, this law only made the changes for 2021. Because Congress has not renewed the CTC expansion for 2022, there are currently no monthly payments. But, if eligible, you can still receive the second half of your payment in one lump sum by filing a 2021 tax return.</p>

            is_the_child_tax_credit_ctc_going_away:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Most of it isn't—at least not yet. But some parts are.</p>
                <p>In 2021, Congress significantly expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The CTC is now worth up to $3,600 per child under six and $3,000 per child ages 6-17.</p>
                <p>If you received monthly payments last year, you have only received half of your payments and need to file a 2021 tax return to get the rest of your money.</p>
                <p>If you didn't receive monthly payments last year, you can get the whole CTC, even if you earn little or no money.</p>
                <p>The changes Congress made were only for one year. That means that, unless Congress acts again, there will not be new monthly payments available this year. It also means that, when you file next year, the CTC will be reduced to $2,000 per child, and you might not receive as much if you have low income.</p>

            what_do_i_do_if_someone_else_has_claimed_my:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Only one tax return can claim a child in any given tax year. Sometimes two different households try to claim the same child because they are trying to share payments, claiming rights are unclear, or there is foul play.</p>
                <p>What you do next depends on when someone else claimed your child.</p>
                <p>If someone claimed your child last year (in 2021 on their 2020 tax return) and prevented you from getting Child Tax Credit (CTC) monthly payments, the most important thing is to file quickly this year. If you file a tax return before the other person claiming your child, you will receive the full CTC amount (including all of the monthly payments you missed out on last year).</p>
                <p>If you try to file a tax return this year and find that someone has already claimed your child and you wish to contest the claim to the IRS in order to receive your payments, the process is more complicated. First, you have to mail a paper copy of your return to the IRS. Next, the IRS will begin a process to determine who is allowed to claim this dependent. This process can be difficult for you and for whoever else claimed your dependent. If you want to pursue this process, see here for more info: https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/identity-theft-dependents.

              answer_html: |
                <p>The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a tax benefit that helps families with the costs of raising children. While the CTC has existed for over two decades, it was significantly expanded in 2021. This year, you can get <strong>up to $3,600 per child under six and $3,000 per child ages 6-17</strong>.</p>
                <p>The credit is smaller for single parents earning over $75,000 and married couples earning over $150,000. Nearly every family under those income levels receives the full amount. You are eligible for the full CTC payments even if you earn very little or no money, and even if you don't usually file taxes.</p>

Last year, CTC UP allowed users to opt out of advance CTC payments, change payment information, and check overall eligibility status.

            why_did_my_spouse_and_i_get_two_different_letters:
              answer_html: |
                <p>If you filed taxes together with your spouse last year and claimed a child for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), the IRS should have issued you monthly CTC payments for your child. Even if you and your spouse filed your taxes together, the IRS treated those payments as if they were going half to you and half to your spouse. The IRS applied this logic in the letters they sent about advance payments. For example if your family got $1,500 in CTC payments, the IRS would send two letters, one to each spouse, reporting $750 of payments each. If you are filing jointly again for 2021, hold on to both letters and report the total payments from the letters added together.</p>
                <p>If you and your spouse have divorced or have chosen to file taxes separately, you should each report only the payment amount from your individual letters.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>In 2021, Congress made significant improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for people without children. These changes apply to the 2021 tax year, meaning they apply to the tax return you file in 2022. First, the credit is now bigger (it used to be worth only up to about $500, it is now worth up to about $1,500). Second, the eligibility rules were loosened. Now, anyone older than 19, if they are not a full time student, can be eligible for the EITC. Former foster youth or youth experiencing homelessness are eligible at age 18.</p>
                <p>There is no change to the EITC for people with children, which is still worth up to about $3,600 with one child, $6,000 with two children, or $6,700 with three children, depending on income.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>GetYourRefund Express, also known as GetCTC or the nonfiler tool, is our simplest and quickest filing option. All you have to do is answer some questions and then we file your tax return directly with the IRS.</p>
                <p>You can use GetYourRefund Express to claim stimulus payments (Economic Impact Payments) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), but not the Earned Income Tax Credit or state tax credits. Generally, you can only use GetYourRefund Express if you are single and made less than $12,500 in 2021, or if you are married and made less than $25,000 in 2021.</p>
                <p>GetYourRefund Express is a great choice for you if you are <em>only</em> looking to get the stimulus payments and the Child Tax Credit, if you are missing your tax documents, or missing a paper copy of your Social Security card.</p>

              answer_html: Letter 6419 is a letter that the IRS sent to everyone who received monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments in 2021. The letters contain information about how much the IRS issued you in these monthly payments. In order to claim the rest of the Child Tax Credit on your 2021 tax return, you will need to report the amount the IRS paid you in advances — so this letter can be very helpful. Letter 6419 was sent in December 2021 or January 2022.

                <p>Accurately reporting how much you received in stimulus checks can help you and your tax preparer correctly claim any missing money—so these letters can be very helpful.

If you did submit a return, you will need to verify your identity, either online or on the phone, according to the instructions on the letter. If you did not submit a tax return, then this letter indicates that a fraudster tried to submit a return using your information. You should follow the instructions to report this fraud to the IRS, to make sure your future payments are not negatively affected.

The notices ask you to confirm a few facts about your and your household in order to claim the credit, which could be worth over $6,000. You should fill out the notice truthfully and mail it back to the IRS.

                <p>If you receive a refund that includes tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit and the IRS has a reason to believe you incorrectly claimed these credits, they may ask for additional information as part of an audit. Audits can also occur if someone else tries to claim your dependent.</p>
                <p>If you are audited, you will receive a letter or notice that asks you to provide additional information like proof of relationship and proof of residency of the dependent in question. The letter will include detailed instructions on what documents the IRS needs. If you need additional assistance in responding to the IRS, low-income taxpayers can seek help from the <a href="https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about-us/low-income-taxpayer-clinics-litc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low Income Taxpayer Clinics</a> (LITC)</p>

Your filing requirement is typically determined by income, filing status, and age. If you were required to file a return in a previous year and now file a current tax return, the IRS may contact you with information about a skipped filing year.

Any refunds you save do not count against any federally-funded public benefit program for 12 months after the refund is received.

              answer_html: |
                <p>If the IRS determines your tax refund was incorrectly calculated, they may require you to repay the ineligible amount, plus interest.

You will report self-employment income when filing your tax return. Self-employment income is reported on Schedule C. This type of income may be recorded in a number of ways:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Form 1099-NEC (Nonemployee Compensation)</li>

              answer_html: |
                <p>Self-employed is a broad description that many people who work now fall into. Generally, when the IRS talks about self-employment they could mean that you are an independent contractor or freelancer, you work on short-term contracts, or own your own business.</p>
                <p>You can be considered self-employed even if you haven't formally launched your own business. Common examples of self-employment work includes driving using a rideshare app like Uber and Lyft, delivering items using an app like Instacart and Doordash, pet sitting or dog walking, and childcare services.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>To get an ITIN, you need to file Form W-7 along with your federal tax return. As part of the application, you will have to provide proof of identity, using original copies of your documents (most often a passport). You can either mail these documents to the IRS, or apply in person through the IRS or through a "Certified Acceptance Agent," who can examine your documents on behalf of the IRS. It is often beneficial to apply in person so that you do not need to mail in your original documents.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>Many people who are not authorized to live in the United States worry that filing taxes increases their exposure to the government, fearing this could ultimately result in deportation. If you already have an ITIN, then the IRS has your information, unless you moved recently. You are not increasing your exposure by renewing an ITIN or filing taxes with an ITIN.</p>
                <p>Current law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing tax return information with other agencies, with a few important exceptions. For instance, tax return information may in certain cases be shared with state agencies responsible for tax administration or with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws. The protections against the disclosure of information are set in law so they cannot be rescinded by a presidential executive order or other administrative action unless Congress changes the law.</p>
                <p>Knowing the potential risks and benefits involved, only proceed with an ITIN application or tax filing if you feel comfortable. This information does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an immigration attorney if you have any concerns.</p>

                <p>In 2020 and 2021, the IRS "nonfiler portal" or "non-filer tool" allowed people who don't typically file returns to file a simple tax return to claim benefits such as the stimulus checks (Economic Impact Payments) and Child Tax Credit (CTC).

            why_would_i_paper_file_my_tax_return:
              answer_html: |
                <p>We strongly recommend filing your tax return electronically whenever possible. E-filing is more reliable, and you will get your tax benefits faster. However, there are situations where the only option is to mail a paper copy of your tax return to the IRS.</p>
                <p>You must paper file if your tax return was rejected for reasons that cannot be resolved by efiling. For example, if your return was rejected because someone else claimed your child, you would have to paper file to claim that child. Similarly, if you were claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, or if you can't find an IP PIN you need, you would have to paper file. By paper filing a tax return in these instances, you are letting the IRS know that they need to investigate the issue further and you should expect to receive a follow-up letter from the IRS with next steps. For example, if you paper filed in order to claim a child that someone else had claimed, you might hear from the IRS about a process to submit evidence to support your case.</p>
                <p>Another common reason to paper file is if you are applying for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for the first time, or renewing an existing ITIN.</p>

                <p>If you live primarily in Puerto Rico and do not have income from outside the island, you generally have to file taxes with the Puerto Rico tax agency (Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico) and <em>not</em> with the IRS. Some Puerto Rico residents are required to file returns with the IRS, and you should consult the rules carefully to make sure whether this applies to you.</p>
                <p>Like for tax benefits in the 50 states, if you want to claim a tax credit like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC), you will need to file a tax return to claim it, though different credits require different returns.</p>

                <p>If you already filed a tax return and are waiting for your refund you can log into your <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/your-online-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRS Online Account</a> for status updates.</p>
                <p>If you already filed a tax return and need to update your information then you need to file an amended tax return (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Form 1040X</a>). To file an amended tax return, it is usually easiest to use the same software or preparer that filed your original tax return.</p>

                <li>If you use GetYourRefund and you need to file an amended tax return you should get back in touch with your tax team. You can chat with our Tax Experts or email <a href="mailto:support@getyourrefund.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@getyourrefund.org</a> to request help with an amended tax return. You will be asked to provide tax documents or information related to the change you would like to make. For example, if you received a new Form W-2 after you completed your tax return, you will need to provide that form to the tax team. The tax team will prepare Form 1040X and, if applicable, an amended state return. In most cases, the amended returns can be e-filed once you provide an electronic signature.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are unable to utilize that same software/service again, you can file an amendment with <a href="http://getyourrefund.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourRefund</a>.

            what_is_agi_and_how_do_i_find_it:
              answer_html: |
                <p>AGI stands for Adjusted Gross Income. If you e-file your own return, you will need to provide the AGI you reported on last year's tax return as a security measure, to prove that you are who you say you are. If you filed a tax return last year, you should be able to find your AGI on Line 11 of your tax return.</p>
                <p>If you can not find a copy of your tax return from last year, you should try to request a copy from the person, organization, or software that helped you file the tax return. If you are still unable to get a copy of your tax return, you can request a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS at their <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Transcript page</a>.</p>
                <p>If you did not file a tax return last year, you should enter $0 as your AGI for 2020. If you used the IRS non-filer tool or GetCTC in 2021, enter $1 as your AGI for 2020.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>An Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) is a six-digit number the IRS provides to people who have been victims of identity theft, or who opted into the IP PIN program. If the IRS has assigned you an IP PIN you are required to provide it when you e-file your tax return. The IP PIN is meant to provide an extra measure of protection against identity theft.</p>
                <p>If you have been the victim of identity theft and the IRS issued you an IP PIN—or if you signed up for the IP PIN program—a new IP PIN would arrive in the mail each year, in what the IRS calls Notice CP01A. The IRS issues a new IP PIN every year—last year's number will not work this year. If you cannot find this year's IP PIN, you can retrieve it online at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/retrieve-your-ip-pin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retrieve Your IP PIN</a>, by calling 800-908-4490, or by making an in-person appointment at your <a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center</a>.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>Many people who are not authorized to live in the United States worry that filing taxes increases their exposure to the government, fearing this could ultimately result in deportation. If you already have an ITIN, then the IRS has your information, unless you moved recently. You are not increasing your exposure by renewing an ITIN or filing taxes with an ITIN.</p>
                <p>Current law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing tax return information with other agencies, with a few important exceptions. For instance, tax return information may in certain cases be shared with state agencies responsible for tax administration or with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws. The protections against the disclosure of information are set in law so they cannot be rescinded by a presidential executive order or other administrative action unless Congress changes the law.</p>
                <p>Knowing the potential risks and benefits involved, only proceed with an ITIN application or tax filing if you feel comfortable. This information does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an immigration attorney if you have any concerns.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>The term "nonfiler" is sometimes used to refer to people who are not required to file a tax return and have not filed a tax return in the past few years. Most "nonfilers" are eligible for thousands of dollars in tax benefits from the Child Tax Credit, stimulus payments, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>
                <p>"Non-filer" is not a legal category—anyone can and should file a return, to claim the tax benefits available. By filing a tax return you are able to access thousands of dollars in tax benefits even if you make little to no money or do not usually file taxes.</p>

                <p>Most tax benefits—including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and stimulus payments—are only available to individuals who cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return. Most individuals who are full-time students between the ages of 19-24 are someone else's dependent (typically their parent or guardian)—unless they can prove that they pay for over half of their living expenses including housing, food, medical/dental, and personal expenses.</p>
                <p>Generally, if you are between the ages of 19 and 24 you should file your own tax return if you are not a full-time student and you made over $4,300 in the tax year.</p>
                <p>Even if you can be claimed on another person's tax return, you may still benefit from filing a tax return if you had a job and taxes were withheld from your paycheck. When filing a return to claim any unused withholdings, make sure to indicate you can be claimed on someone else's tax return.</p>

                <p>Even if you make little to no income and are not required to file a tax return, you likely qualify for payments from the IRS—perhaps totaling thousands of dollars. You are especially likely to qualify for payments if you have children. In order to claim this money, you need to file a tax return.</p>
                <p>Filing a tax return may also serve as useful documentation when applying for other benefits, like financial aid for college, or a home loan.</p>

                <p>California has a number of beneficial state tax credits like CalEITC, Child and Dependent Care Expenses Credit, and College access tax credit. These credits add up quickly to mean even more money in your pockets. In order to claim these credits you need to file a California state tax return. We recommend filing this return at the same time that you file your federal tax return. Learn more about the CalEITC <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/california-earned-income-tax-credit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
                <p>CalEITC eligibility rules are slightly different from the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). To qualify you must:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Be at least 18 years old or have a qualifying child</li>
                <li>Have taxable earned income</li>
                <li>Have a SSN <strong>or</strong> ITIN for you, your spouse, and any qualifying children</li>
                <li>Must not file married filing separately</li>
                <li>Live in California for more than half the year</li>

                <p>Stimulus payments were issued automatically to families who had recently filed tax returns, or who were enrolled in certain federal programs. If you missed any of the three stimulus payments, you will need to file a tax return to claim the amount you missed. Your missing stimulus payments are called the Recovery Rebate Credit.</p>
                <p>To claim all or part of your third stimulus payment, you need to file a tax return for 2021. You can file for free using any of our services on <a href="http://getyourrefund.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourRefund</a>.</p>

                <p>A total of three stimulus payments (also known as Economic Impact Payments) were issued between 2020 and 2021, to help families cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p>The <strong>first stimulus payment </strong>was issued in March/April 2020 and provided up to $1,200 per eligible adult and up to $500 for each qualifying dependent.</p>
                <p>The <strong>second stimulus payment</strong> was issued in December 2020 and provided up to $600 per eligible person (adult, child, or dependent).</p>
                <p>The <strong>third stimulus payment</strong> was issued in March/April 2021 and provided up to $1,400 per eligible person (adult, child, or dependent).</p>

                <p>After your return is accepted by the IRS electronically it typically takes 2-3 weeks to receive a direct deposit or 4-6 weeks to receive a check in the mail. However, there are a few common reasons your refund may be delayed, which include:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Your return needs a correction for the amount of the Advanced Child Tax Credit payments you reported receiving</li>

                <li>This is the first time you have filed taxes in several years</li>
                <li>Your return Is affected by identity theft</li>
                <li>Includes 2019 earned income to calculate the Earned Income Tax Credit</li>
                <li>Information is incomplete or doesn't match the IRS's records</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your return meets any of those circumstances, the IRS may contact you and request additional information. These delays can take months to resolve. It is important to keep an eye out for any letters or notices from the IRS and to follow any next steps to ensure you get your refund as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>To avoid delays, make sure you double check all the information you provide when filing a tax return. When in doubt, wait to file until you have all the information you need!</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>In some cases, you can claim your parent as a dependent on your tax return. Generally, in order to claim your parent, they must have earned less than $4,300 in 2021 and you must pay for at least half of their living expenses.</p>
                <p>Claiming your parent will not qualify you for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), or for an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Claiming your parent could increase your Recovery Rebate Credit (RRC) for missing stimulus payments.</p>

              answer_html: Depending on your situation, you could get up to about $10,000 for every child you can claim on your tax return. When you claim children on your taxes, you might establish eligibility for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), and increase the size of your Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and your Recovery Rebate Credit (RRC — also known as the third stimulus check, from 2021).
              question: What are the benefits of claiming a child on my tax return?
            what_should_i_do_if_i_was_claimed_as_a:
              answer_html: |
                <p>If someone claimed you as their dependent, first, you should determine whether they were in fact allowed to do so. Generally, if someone else (like a parent, grandparent, or guardian) pays for more than half of your living expenses and you live with them for most of the year, then you are their dependent. That means you do not qualify for most tax benefits (like the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, or stimulus payments), and you generally can not file your own tax return.</p>
                <p>If you think someone claimed you incorrectly, you can appeal—but unfortunately this process isn't easy. First, you'll have to mail a paper copy of your return to the IRS. (See 'How Do I Paper File'.) Next, the IRS will begin a process to determine whether the other person's claim was valid. This process can be difficult for you and for whoever else claimed you, as you may both have to provide documentation supporting your case.</p>
              question: What should I do if I was claimed as a dependent but I want to file my own taxes?
            who_can_i_claim_on_my_return:
              answer_html: |
                <p>You can claim many relatives that financially rely on you for support as "dependents" on your tax return, though the rules for different relatives can be a little complicated.</p>
                <p>The most common dependent is your children. Generally speaking, the IRS allows you to claim your child if they live with you most of the year, they are not financially independent, they were under 19 on the last day of the year, and you are the family member best positioned to claim them. You can also treat your stepchildren and nephews/nieces as your children under this definition.</p>
                <p>You can in some cases claim other relatives, including aging parents, if you provide for most of their needs financially, and they earn very little themselves.</p>
                <p>Various exceptions apply to both of these definitions. Most tax preparation services (including GetYourRefund) will walk you through the definitions and make sure it is appropriate for you to claim your relatives.</p>

            - title: Will the EIP check affect my other government benefits?
              content_html: No, the EIP checks are treated as a tax credit. This means your payment will not impact the benefits you receive now or in the future.
            - title: I still need to file a tax return. How long are the economic impact payments available?
              content_html: These payments will continue to be available by filing a tax return. Although the official deadline is May 17, you can continue to file until October 15 via GetYourRefund.org.
            - title: If I owe taxes, or have a payment agreement with the IRS, or owe other federal or state debts, will I still get the EIP?
              content_html: While the stimulus payments made in 2020 were protected from garnishment, the same is not true for payments made through Rebate Recovery Credits.
            - title: What if I am overdrawn at my bank?
              content_html: If your bank or credit union has taken a portion of your EIP to cover money you owe them, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/consumer-advisory-protect-your-economic-payment-if-your-account-is-overdrawn/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends</a> calling them to ask if they are willing to be flexible.
            - title: What if someone offers a quicker payment?
              content_html: Don’t click on links whose origins you aren’t 100% sure of. Be wary of scams. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. And don’t send money to someone you don’t know.  Look at the fees being charged if you are paying for your tax preparation service or a refund anticipation loan by having them deducted from your refund.

        intro:
          common_questions: We know there are many questions around the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) and we have some answers! We’ve broken down some common questions to help you out.
          description:
          - The federal government has begun sending out the third round of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), often called a stimulus check. In this round, individuals can receive up to $1,400 for themselves or $2,800 for a married couple filing jointly and an additional $1,400 for every dependent.
          - If you have not yet received this payment or earlier rounds of payments, it is not too late! You can still claim them by filing a tax return this year.
          eligibility:
            header: Who is eligible?
            info:
            - For the first round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples and up to $500 for each qualifying child under the age of 17.  For the second round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child.
            - In each round of payments, tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals, up to $112,500 for those filing as head of household, or up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns receive the full payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount phases down gradually.
            - In the first two rounds of payments, only children under age 17 could be claimed for the dependent payment. Other dependents were not eligible—and also could not claim the EIP themselves. In the third round of payments, all dependents, including college students and adult dependents can be claimed.  In addition, as discussed below, some children in mixed-immigration status households who were previously ineligible, can receive the third payment.
            - 'The IRS made the first two rounds of payments based on the information it had from 2018 or 2019 tax returns.  If you are eligible for a larger payment based on your 2020 information, you can claim that credit when you file your 2020 return.  For example:'
            info_last_html:
            - To claim this credit, you will need to report how much you received from the two EIPs in 2020. However, you will not have to repay the stimulus payments you received if your income went up in 2020 or the number of dependents you claimed went down.  You will need to complete <a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#idm140693714589984">the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet</a> for line 30 of the 2020 1040 tax form. We can assist you with these forms if you file your return through GetYourRefund.
            - If you have any earned income or dependents, you may be able to access additional tax credits or benefits by filing or updating your info with the IRS. Please reach out via chat for more information.
            list:
            - You only got a partial payment due to the phase out, but you lost your job due to COVID-19 and your income was lower in 2020 than in 2019.
            - You had a new baby in 2020.
            - You could be claimed as someone else’s dependent in 2019, but not in 2020.
            - You were not required to file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, and missed the deadline for using the non-filers portal to claim the payments.
          irs_info_html: The IRS will post all key information on %{irs_eip_link} as soon as it becomes available.
          last_updated: Updated on April 6, 2021
          mixed_status_eligibility:
            header: Are mixed immigration status families eligible?
            info_html:
            - Originally, mixed status families were not eligible for the first round of payments. However, now mixed status families can claim both the first and second round of payments on this year’s tax return. For the second round of payments, if you jointly file with your spouse and only one of you has a valid Social Security Number, the spouse with the valid SSN will receive up to $600 and up to $600 for any qualifying children with SSNs. However, the spouse without a valid SSN is not eligible. The same rules now apply for the first round of payments as well.
            - |-
              For the third round of payments, taxpayers who file with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) can claim the EIP for their dependents who have Social Security Numbers.  You may obtain an ITIN by filing the <a
