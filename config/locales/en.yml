          header: Help getting started
          how_long:
            a1: All in all GetYourRefund takes 5-10 business days to complete because you work one on one with a tax preparer.
            a2: The first step is to answer questions about your tax situation in our online form and upload your tax documents, which can take 10-30 minutes. Next, you will receive a call from your tax specialist in 2-3 business days to discuss your tax situation. Your tax return will then be prepared and quality reviewed by an IRS-certified tax preparer who will call you to discuss your refund and the process for electronic signature and filing. After taxes are filed we have heard from clients that they receive a direct deposit from the IRS within a week.
            q: How long will this take?
          how_to_start:
            a: To get started, go to GetYourRefund.org, click “Get Started,” and let us know that you want to “Start my taxes online.” You will have to upload photos of your ID, answer some questions about your tax situation, and upload your tax documents. Then one of our tax specialists will call you on the phone to discuss your taxes, answer any questions, and complete your filing.
            q: How do I get started?

          missing_docs:
            a_html: If you have lost or never received a tax document, the first place to try is your employer. Often your employer can quickly re-issue your tax forms to you. If that doesn’t work, you can request your tax documents from the IRS at %{transcript_link}.
            q: What should I do if I can’t find a tax document?
          non_filer:
            a: We can file your taxes for 2017, 2018, and 2019. We encourage you to let us know if you haven’t yet filed for these years, because this can help you claim refunds from previous years that you may have missed out on.
            q: What should I do if I haven’t filed in several years?

                content_html: >-
                  No, the EIP checks are treated as a tax credit. This means your payment will not impact
                  the benefits you receive now or in the future.
              - title: I still need to file a tax return. How long are the economic impact payments available?
                content_html: >-
                  These payments will continue to be available by filing a tax return. Although the
                  official deadline is May 17, you can continue to file until October 15 via GetYourRefund.org.

                  While the stimulus payments made in 2020 were protected from garnishment, the same is

                  If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. And don’t send money to
                  someone you don’t know.  Look at the fees being charged if you are paying
                  for your tax preparation service or a refund anticipation loan by having
                  them deducted from your refund.

        header: Get your Stimulus Check (EIP)
        intro:
          common_questions: >-
            We know there are many questions around the Economic Impact Payments
            (EIP) and we have some answers! We’ve broken down some common questions
            to help you out.
          description:
            - >-
              The federal government has begun sending out the third round of Economic
              Impact Payments (EIPs), often called a stimulus check. In this round,
              individuals can receive up to $1,400 for themselves or $2,800 for a married
              couple filing jointly and an additional $1,400 for every dependent.
            - >-
              If you have not yet received this payment or earlier rounds of payments, it
              is not too late! You can still claim them by filing a tax return this year.
          eligibility:
            header: Who is eligible?
            list:
              - You only got a partial payment due to the phase out, but you lost your job due to COVID-19 and your income was lower in 2020 than in 2019.
              - You had a new baby in 2020.
              - You could be claimed as someone else’s dependent in 2019, but not in 2020.
              - You were not required to file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, and missed the deadline for using the non-filers portal to claim the payments.
            info:
              - >-
                For the first round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $1,200
                for individuals or $2,400 for married couples and up to $500 for each qualifying child under the
                age of 17.  For the second round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of
                up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child.
              - >-
                In each round of payments, tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals,
                up to $112,500 for those filing as head of household, or up to $150,000 for married couples
                filing joint returns receive the full payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the
                payment amount phases down gradually.
              - >-
                In the first two rounds of payments, only children under age 17 could be claimed for the
                dependent payment. Other dependents were not eligible—and also could not claim the EIP
                themselves. In the third round of payments, all dependents, including college students and
                adult dependents can be claimed.  In addition, as discussed below, some children in
                mixed-immigration status households who were previously ineligible, can receive the third payment.
              - >-
                The IRS made the first two rounds of payments based on the information it had from 2018 or
                2019 tax returns.  If you are eligible for a larger payment based on your 2020 information, you
                can claim that credit when you file your 2020 return.  For example:
            info_last_html:
              - >-
                To claim this credit, you will need to report how much you received from the two EIPs in 2020.
                However, you will not have to repay the stimulus payments you received if your income went
                up in 2020 or the number of dependents you claimed went down.  You will need to complete <a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#idm140693714589984">the
                Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet</a> for line 30 of the 2020 1040 tax form. We can assist you with these
                forms if you file your return through GetYourRefund.
              - >-
                If you have any earned income or dependents, you may be able to access additional tax credits
                or benefits by filing or updating your info with the IRS. Please reach out via chat for more
                information.
          mixed_status_eligibility:
            header: Are mixed immigration status families eligible?
            info_html:
              - >-
                Originally, mixed status families were not eligible for the first round of payments.
                However, now mixed status families can claim both the first and second round of payments on this year’s
                tax return. For the second round of payments, if you jointly file with your spouse and only one
                of you has a valid Social Security Number, the spouse with the valid SSN will receive up to $600 and
                up to $600 for any qualifying children with SSNs. However, the spouse without a valid SSN is not
                eligible. The same rules now apply for the first round of payments as well.
              - >-
                For the third round of payments, taxpayers who file with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs)
                can claim the EIP for their dependents who have Social Security Numbers.  You may obtain an ITIN by filing
