            answer_html: |
              If your children have social security number(s) but you do not, then you can use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) in order to claim the Child Tax Credit.
              <br/><br/>
              To apply for an ITIN, you must submit <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7'>Form W-7</a> to the IRS along with the required identity verification (like a passport, driver's license, or birth certificate). You can see a full list of identity verification document options listed <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw7'>here</a> under “Supporting Documentation”.
              <br/><br/>
              You can submit your W-7 and identity verification documents through the mail (using the address shown on Form W-7), in person at an <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office'>IRS office</a>, or through a <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/acceptance-agent-program'>Certified Acceptance Agent</a>.

          how_do_i_know_what_i_received_for_the_stimulus:
            answer_html: |
              In order to claim the Child Tax Credit, you will need to report the amount you may be missing in stimulus payments (Economic Impact Payments).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>first stimulus payment</b> was sent in April 2020 and was $1,200 per adult tax filer plus $500 per dependent under 17 years old (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $2,200).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>second stimulus payment</b> was sent in December 2020 and was $600 per adult tax filer plus $600 per dependent (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $1,800).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>third stimulus payment</b> was sent in April 2021 and was $1,400 per adult tax filer plus $1,400 per dependent of any age (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $4,200).
            question: How do I know what I received for the stimulus (Economic Impact Payments)?
          how_much_is_the_child_tax_credit_in_2022: How much is the CTC in 2022?
          is_the_child_tax_credit_ctc_going_away: Is CTC going away?
          no_income_or_income_from_benefits_programs:
            answer_html: |
              There is no minimum income required to get the Child Tax Credit for tax year 2021. Even if your family has $0 in reported income and didn’t work during the previous year, you can still be eligible for the full Child Tax Credit as long as you have a child who has a Social Security Number and was younger than 17 at the end of 2020.
              <br/><br/>
              If your only income was from benefits programs, we recommend that you use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal to receive cash benefits for your family.
              <br/><br/>
              If you earned income from a benefits program and also some income from working, you have the option to file a full tax return in order to receive the additional benefits that you may qualify for.
            question: What if I don’t have any income, or only income from benefits programs (like SSI, SNAP, TANF, or WIC)?
          parents_with_shared_custody:
            answer_html: |
              If you are married and signing up for the Child Tax Credit jointly with your spouse, you will receive one monthly payment per child, as a family.
              <br/><br/>
              If you file separately from any other caretakers for your child, then only one person can sign up to receive the Child Tax Credit.
            question: Can parents who share custody of a child both get the Child Tax Credit?

          what_will_happen_and_when:
            answer_html: |
              If the IRS thinks your family is eligible for the Child Tax Credit and already has the information it needs to pay you automatically, you should have received a postcard or letter from the IRS in June 2021.
              <br/><br/>
              If you have already filed taxes for tax years 2019 or 2020, you will begin receiving your payments automatically on July 15, 2021, and then on or about the 15th of each month for the next 6 months.
              <br/><br/>
              If you have not filed taxes in the past two years and need to submit information to claim the Child Tax Credit, you can use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal.
              <br/><br/>
              If you need to update your address or banking information with the IRS you can use the <strong><a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal'>CTC Update Portal (CTC UP)</a></strong> ahead of your August payment. Coming soon: at a later date, the update portal will give you the ability to update your household information.
            question: What will happen and when?
          what_will_i_need_to_submit:
            answer_html: |
              Signing up for the Child Tax Credit is simple: you only need a working email address or phone number and the social security numbers of any children you want to claim.<br/><br/>
              Children claimed for the Child Tax Credit must have a valid Social security number (SSN), however the tax filer (a parent, grandparent, or guardian) can have either a SSN or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).
            question: I don’t usually file taxes, what will I need to submit to sign up for the Child Tax Credit?
          will_i_ever_have_to_pay_this_money_back:
            answer_html: If you receive payments for a child who is no longer your dependent or if your income has drastically changed, you may have to pay that money back, though there are some protections in place for those with incomes below $80,000 (for individuals or non custodial parents), $100,000 (for single, head-of-household), or $120,000 (for filing jointly).
            question: Will I ever have to pay this money back?
          will_it_affect_my_immigration_status:
            answer_html: No, receiving the Child Tax Credit or other tax credits that you are eligible for, will not affect your immigration status, your ability to get a green card, or your future immigration plans. Use of tax credits is not considered in a “public charge” determination by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
            question: Will receiving the Child Tax Credit affect my immigration status or my ability to get a green card?

            <p>Congress passed three rounds of stimulus checks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, December 2020, and March 2021. All together, the payments are worth up to $3,200 per adult and up to $2,500 per child in your family. The payments are formally known as Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), or as the Recovery Rebate Credit (RRC). </p>

                <p>In order to claim the Child and Dependent Care credit, you must have:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Paid for care in 2022 for a qualifying child under the age of 13, or a spouse or dependent unable to care for themselves.</li>
                <li>Needed this care in order to work or look for work yourself. In a two-parent household, both spouses must have been working or looking for work (or a full-time student).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When filing a tax return, you will need to report the amount you paid, as well as the care provider's name, Employer Identification Number (EIN), and address. If your child care was provided by an individual, you'll need their name, Social Security Number, and address.</p>

            what_is_the_child_and_dependent_care_credit:
              answer_html: |
                <p>The Child and Dependent Care Credit is a tax credit that helps families cover expenses for child care needed to work or to look for work. The credit is also available to families that must pay for the care of a spouse or other adult relative who isn't mentally or physically able to care for themselves. Families can claim up to $3,000 for one child/dependent or $6,000 for two or more children/dependents.The credit covers 20 to 35% of the cost of child care. The percentage is based on your earned income and Adjusted Gross Income (if married filing jointly your spouse must also be working to meet the requirements). You must report earned income during 2022 to claim the credit.</p>
                <p>Please note, the amounts for this credit have reverted back to their original amounts for 2022.</p>

                <p>To be eligible for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), each child claimed must have a Social Security Number (SSN) and each parent must have either a Social Security Number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN).</p>
                <p>If you do not currently have an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN), but want to claim the Child Tax Credit for your children, you can apply for an ITIN with the support of a certified tax preparer using <a href="https://www.getyourrefund.org/en/questions/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourRefund</a>.</p>

                <p>You cannot claim a baby born in 2023 yet; you'll have to wait until 2024. When you file taxes, you can only include information for that tax year. Even though you are filing your 2022 taxes in 2023, you can only include income, children, marriages, etc. that occurred in 2022.</p>

            how_much_is_the_child_tax_credit_in_2022:
              answer_html: |
                <p>For 2022, the CTC has reverted back to it's original design as a nonrefundable tax credit - meaning it only reduces a person's tax liability by up to $2,000 per eligible child and is not paid out as a refund. A nonrefundable tax credit means it is not issued as a refund but only applied to taxes owed on that tax return.</p>
                <p>When you file your 2022 tax return, the Child Tax Credit will be on your tax return as a nonrefundable tax credit reducing your tax liability.</p>
              question: How much is the Child Tax Credit in 2022?
            i_owe_back_child_support_can_i_still_get_all:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Probably not. </p>
                <p>If you owe back child support, some payments you get from the government can be taken (or "garnished") to pay your child support debt. IRS payments like tax refunds are subject to this process.</p>
                <p>Notably, the CTC monthly payments issued in 2021 were <em>not</em> taken to cover child support debts. Any amount you claim this year, though—whether it is the second half of the credit, or the whole credit—can be taken.</p>
              question: I owe back child support, can I still get all of the Child Tax Credit?
            i_was_getting_child_tax_credit_monthly_payments_in_2021:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) started in July 2021 based on a law Congress passed earlier that year, which made significant expansions to the CTC. Unfortunately, this law only applied to 2021. Because Congress did not renew the CTC expansion for 2022, there were no monthly payments last year. However, if you did not receive CTC on our 2021 tax return, you still may be eligible to claim it by filing an amendment for your 2021 return.</p>
                <p>You can file a 2021 tax return through our GetYourRefund full service.</p>
              question: I was getting Child Tax Credit monthly payments in 2021. Why didn’t I get my CTC monthly payment in 2022?
            title: Child Tax Credit
            why_did_my_spouse_and_i_get_two_different_letters:
              answer_html: Letter 6419 is a letter that the IRS sent to everyone who received monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments in 2021. The letters contain information about how much the IRS issued you in these monthly payments. If you did not file a 2021 return but you received Child Tax Credit payments in 2021, in order to claim the rest of the Child Tax Credit, you will need to report the amount the IRS paid you in advance — so this letter can be very helpful. Letter 6419 was sent in December 2021 or January 2022.

              answer_html: Letter 6419 is a letter that the IRS sent to everyone who received monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments in 2021. The letters contain information about how much the IRS issued you in these monthly payments. If you did not yet file a 2021 return, to claim the rest of the Child Tax Credit, you will need to report the amount the IRS paid you in advance. Letter 6419 was sent in December 2021 or January 2022.

                <p>Letter 6475 and 1444-C are letters the IRS sent to everyone who received the third stimulus check (Economic Impact Payment), which was issued starting in March 2021. The letters contain information about how much the IRS issued you in the third stimulus check.</p>
                <p>If you have not yet filed your 2021 return, accurately reporting how much you received in stimulus checks can help you and your tax preparer correctly claim any missing money—so these letters can be very helpful. Letter 1444-C would have been sent around the time your payment was issued in March 2021. Letter 6475 was sent in January 2022.</p>

              answer_html: Notice 4883C and 5071C are letters the IRS sends if they have received a tax return for you and they are concerned it might be fraudulent. If you did submit a return, you will need to verify your identity, either online or on the phone, according to the instructions on the letter. If you did not submit a tax return, then this letter indicates that a fraudster tried to submit a return using your information. You should follow the instructions to report this fraud to the IRS, to make sure your future payments are not negatively affected.

The notices ask you to confirm a few facts about your and your household in order to claim the credit, which could be worth over $6,000. You should fill out the notice truthfully and mail it back to the IRS.

                <p>If you receive a refund that includes tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit and the IRS has a reason to believe you incorrectly claimed these credits, they may ask for additional information as part of an audit. Audits can also occur if someone else tries to claim your dependent.</p>
                <p>If you are audited, you will receive a letter or notice that asks you to provide additional information like proof of relationship and proof of residency of the dependent in question. The letter will include detailed instructions on what documents the IRS needs.

Your filing requirement is typically determined by income, filing status, and age. If you were required to file a return in a previous year and now file a current tax return, the IRS may contact you with information about a skipped filing year.

Any refunds you save do not count against any federally-funded public benefit program for 12 months after the refund is received.

              answer_html: |
                <p>If the IRS determines your tax refund was incorrectly calculated, they may require you to repay the ineligible amount, plus interest. There may be additional penalties and consequences if the IRS determines that you were reckless or intentionally disregarded the rules of claiming these credits. Aren't sure if you qualify for tax credits? Chat with our tax experts.</p>
                <p>If you received CTC monthly payments incorrectly you will not need to repay any of them, even if they are wrong. This is the case, as long as you do not earn more than $55,000 single or $66,000 married.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>You are required to file taxes if you make more than $400 in self-employment income. You will report self-employment income when filing your tax return. This type of income may be recorded in a number of ways, but commonly on:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Form 1099-NEC (Nonemployee Compensation)</li>
                <li>Form 1099-K (Payment Card and Third-Party Network Transaction)</li>

                </ul>
                <p>It is important to closely track all of your income and expenses if you are self-employed because they may not be tracked by companies or individuals you work with. However, you are still required to report income and expenses obtained through self-employment on your tax return.</p>

            what_do_you_mean_by_selfemployed:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Self-employed is a broad description that many people who work now fall into. Generally, when the IRS talks about self-employment they could mean that you are an independent contractor or freelancer, you work on short-term contracts, or own your own business.</p>
                <p>You can be considered self-employed even if you haven't formally launched your own business. Common examples of self-employment work includes driving using a rideshare app like Uber and Lyft, delivering items using an app like Instacart and Doordash, pet sitting or dog walking, and childcare services.</p>

An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted within a specific business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for the taxpayer's trade or business.</p>
                <p>Examples of some of the most common expenses include:</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>To get an ITIN, you need to file Form W-7 along with your federal tax return. As part of the application, you will have to provide proof of identity, using original copies of your documents (most often a passport and birth certificate). You can either mail these documents to the IRS, or apply in person through the IRS or through a "Certified Acceptance Agent," who can examine and validate the authenticity of your documents on behalf of the IRS. It is often beneficial to apply in person so that you do not need to mail in your original documents.</p>
                <p>GetYourRefund does not currently offer support for obtaining an ITIN. Please use our VITA Location Finder to find an in-person site near you. Note that not all in-person sites can help with applying and renewing an ITIN. We recommend contacting the office directly to confirm.</p>

            if_i_file_my_taxes_can_ice_get_my_data:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Many people who are not authorized to live in the United States worry that filing taxes increases their exposure to the government, fearing this could ultimately result in deportation. If you already have an ITIN, then the IRS has your information, unless you moved recently. You are not increasing your exposure by renewing an ITIN or filing taxes with an ITIN.</p>
                <p>Current law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing tax return information with other agencies, with a few important exceptions. For instance, tax return information may in certain cases be shared with state agencies responsible for tax administration or with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws. The protections against the disclosure of information are set in law so they cannot be rescinded by a presidential executive order or other administrative action unless Congress changes the law.</p>
                <p>Knowing the potential risks and benefits involved, only proceed with an ITIN application or tax filing if you feel comfortable. This information does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an immigration attorney if you have any concerns.</p>

            why_would_i_paper_file_my_tax_return:
              answer_html: |
                <p>We strongly recommend filing your tax return electronically whenever possible. E-filing is more reliable, and you will get your tax benefits faster. However, there are situations where the only option is to mail a paper copy of your tax return to the IRS.</p>
                <p>You must paper file if your tax return was rejected for reasons that cannot be resolved by efiling. For example, if your return was rejected because someone else claimed your child, you would have to paper file to claim that child. Similarly, if you were claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, or if you can't find an IP PIN you need, you would have to paper file. By paper filing a tax return in these instances, you are letting the IRS know that they need to investigate the issue further and you should expect to receive a follow-up letter from the IRS with next steps. For example, if you paper filed in order to claim a child that someone else had claimed, you might hear from the IRS about a process to submit evidence to support your case.</p>
                <p>Another common reason to paper file is if you are applying for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for the first time, or renewing an existing ITIN.</p>

                <p>If you live primarily in Puerto Rico and do not have income from outside the island, you generally have to file taxes with the Puerto Rico tax agency (Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico) and <em>not</em> with the IRS. Some Puerto Rico residents are required to file returns with the IRS, and you should consult the rules carefully to make sure whether this applies to you.</p>
                <p>Like for tax benefits in the 50 states, if you want to claim a tax credit like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC), you will need to file a tax return to claim it, though different credits require different returns.</p>

              answer_html: Unlike the Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Puerto Rico is administered by the Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico, not by the IRS. To claim the EITC, you will have to file a Puerto Rico tax return with the department.

              answer_html: |
                <p>AGI stands for Adjusted Gross Income. If you e-file your own return, you will need to provide the AGI you reported on last year's tax return as a security measure, to prove that you are who you say you are. If you filed a tax return last year, you should be able to find your AGI on Line 11 of your tax return.</p>
                <p>If you cannot find a copy of your tax return from last year, you should try to request a copy from the person, organization or software that helped you file the tax return. If you are still unable to get a copy of your tax return, you can request a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS at their Get Transcript page.</p>
                <p>If you did not file a tax return last year, you should enter $0 as your AGI for 2022. If you used our GetCTC tool last year, enter $1 as your AGI for 2021.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>An Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) is a six-digit number the IRS provides to people who have been victims of identity theft, or who opted into the IP PIN program. If the IRS has assigned you an IP PIN you are required to provide it when you e-file your tax return. The IP PIN is meant to provide an extra measure of protection against identity theft.</p>
                <p>If you have been the victim of identity theft and the IRS issued you an IP PIN—or if you signed up for the IP PIN program—a new IP PIN would arrive in the mail each year, in what the IRS calls Notice CP01A. The IRS issues a new IP PIN every year—last year's number will not work this year. If you cannot find this year's IP PIN, you can retrieve it online at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/retrieve-your-ip-pin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retrieve Your IP PIN</a>, by calling 800-908-4490, or by making an in-person appointment at your <a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center</a>.</p>

              answer_html: |
                <p>Many people who are not authorized to live in the United States worry that filing taxes increases their exposure to the government, fearing this could ultimately result in deportation. If you already have an ITIN, then the IRS has your information, unless you moved recently. You are not increasing your exposure by renewing an ITIN or filing taxes with an ITIN.</p>
                <p>Current law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing tax return information with other agencies, with a few important exceptions. For instance, tax return information may in certain cases be shared with state agencies responsible for tax administration or with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws. The protections against the disclosure of information are set in law so they cannot be rescinded by a presidential executive order or other administrative action unless Congress changes the law.</p>
                <p>Knowing the potential risks and benefits involved, only proceed with an ITIN application or tax filing if you feel comfortable. This information does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an immigration attorney if you have any concerns.</p>

                <p>Most tax benefits—including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and stimulus payments—are only available to individuals who cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return. Most individuals who are full-time students between the ages of 19-24 are someone else's dependent (typically their parent or guardian)—unless they can prove that they pay for over half of their living expenses including housing, food, medical/dental, and personal expenses.</p>
                <p>Generally, if you are between the ages of 19 and 24 you should file your own tax return if you are not a full-time student and you made over $4,300 in the tax year.</p>
                <p>Even if you can be claimed on another person's tax return, you may still benefit from filing a tax return if you had a job and taxes were withheld from your paycheck. When filing a return to claim any unused withholdings, make sure to indicate you can be claimed on someone else's tax return.</p>

                <p>California has a number of beneficial state tax credits like CalEITC, Child and Dependent Care Expenses Credit, and College access tax credit.

The first payment is sometimes referred to as EIP1, the second as EIP2, and the third as EIP3.

                <p>After your return is accepted by the IRS electronically it typically takes 2-3 weeks to receive a direct deposit or 4-6 weeks to receive a check in the mail. However, there are a few common reasons your refund may be delayed, which include:</p>
                <ul class="list--bulleted">
                <li>Your return needs a correction for the amount of the Advance Child Tax Credit payments you reported receiving</li>

                <li>This is the first time you have filed taxes in several years</li>
                <li>Your return Is affected by identity theft</li>
                <li>Includes 2019 earned income to calculate the Earned Income Tax Credit</li>
                <li>Information is incomplete or doesn't match the IRS's records</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your return meets any of those circumstances, the IRS may contact you and request additional information. These delays can take months to resolve. It is important to keep an eye out for any letters or notices from the IRS and to follow any next steps to ensure you get your refund as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>To avoid delays, make sure you double check all the information you provide when filing a tax return. When in doubt, wait to file until you have all the information you need!</p>

            can_i_claim_my_parent:
              answer_html: |
                <p>In some cases, you can claim your parent as a dependent on your tax return. Generally, in order to claim your parent, they must have earned less than $4,400 in 2022 and you must pay for at least half of their living expenses.</p>
                <p>Claiming your parent will not qualify you for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) or for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).</p>

            title: Who should I include on my tax return?
            what_are_the_benefits_of_claiming_a_child_on_my:
              answer_html: |
                <p>Depending on your situation, you could get additional benefits for every child you are eligible to claim on your tax return. When you claim children on your taxes, you might establish eligibility for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and increase the amount of your Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).</p>
                <p>You can claim these credits by filing a 2022 tax return through our GetYourRefund full service.</p>
              question: What are the benefits of claiming a child on my tax return?
            what_should_i_do_if_i_was_claimed_as_a:
              answer_html: |
                <p>If someone claimed you as their dependent, first, you should determine whether they were in fact allowed to do so. Generally, if someone else (like a parent, grandparent, or guardian) pays for more than half of your living expenses and you live with them for most of the year, then you are their dependent. That means you do not qualify for most tax benefits (like the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, or stimulus payments), and you generally can not file your own tax return.</p>
                <p>If you think someone claimed you incorrectly, you can appeal—but unfortunately this process isn't easy. First, you'll have to mail a paper copy of your return to the IRS. (See 'How Do I Paper File'.) Next, the IRS will begin a process to determine whether the other person's claim was valid. This process can be difficult for you and for whoever else claimed you, as you may both have to provide documentation supporting your case.</p>
              question: What should I do if I was claimed as a dependent but I want to file my own taxes?
            who_can_i_claim_on_my_return:
              answer_html: |
                <p>You can claim many relatives that financially rely on you for support as "dependents" on your tax return, though the rules for different relatives can be a little complicated.</p>
                <p>The most common dependent is your children. Generally speaking, the IRS allows you to claim your child if they live with you most of the year, they are not financially independent, they were under 19 on the last day of the year, and you are the family member best positioned to claim them. You can also treat your stepchildren and nephews/nieces as your children under this definition.</p>
                <p>You can in some cases claim other relatives, including aging parents, if you provide for most of their needs financially, and they earn very little themselves.</p>
                <p>Various exceptions apply to both of these definitions. Most tax preparation services (including GetYourRefund) will walk you through the definitions and make sure it is appropriate for you to claim your relatives.</p>

            - title: Will the EIP check affect my other government benefits?
              content_html: No, the EIP checks are treated as a tax credit. This means your payment will not impact the benefits you receive now or in the future.
            - title: I still need to file a tax return. How long are the economic impact payments available?
              content_html: These payments will continue to be available by filing a tax return. Although the official deadline is May 17, you can continue to file until October 15 via GetYourRefund.org.
            - title: If I owe taxes, or have a payment agreement with the IRS, or owe other federal or state debts, will I still get the EIP?
              content_html: While the stimulus payments made in 2020 were protected from garnishment, the same is not true for payments made through Rebate Recovery Credits.
            - title: What if I am overdrawn at my bank?
              content_html: If your bank or credit union has taken a portion of your EIP to cover money you owe them, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/consumer-advisory-protect-your-economic-payment-if-your-account-is-overdrawn/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends</a> calling them to ask if they are willing to be flexible.
            - title: What if someone offers a quicker payment?
              content_html: Don’t click on links whose origins you aren’t 100% sure of. Be wary of scams. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. And don’t send money to someone you don’t know.  Look at the fees being charged if you are paying for your tax preparation service or a refund anticipation loan by having them deducted from your refund.

        header: Get your Stimulus Check (EIP)
        intro:
          common_questions: We know there are many questions around the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) and we have some answers! We’ve broken down some common questions to help you out.
          description:
          - The federal government has begun sending out the third round of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), often called a stimulus check. In this round, individuals can receive up to $1,400 for themselves or $2,800 for a married couple filing jointly and an additional $1,400 for every dependent.
          - If you have not yet received this payment or earlier rounds of payments, it is not too late! You can still claim them by filing a tax return this year.
          eligibility:
            header: Who is eligible?
            info:
            - For the first round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples and up to $500 for each qualifying child under the age of 17.  For the second round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child.
            - In each round of payments, tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals, up to $112,500 for those filing as head of household, or up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns receive the full payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount phases down gradually.
            - In the first two rounds of payments, only children under age 17 could be claimed for the dependent payment. Other dependents were not eligible—and also could not claim the EIP themselves. In the third round of payments, all dependents, including college students and adult dependents can be claimed.  In addition, as discussed below, some children in mixed-immigration status households who were previously ineligible, can receive the third payment.
            - 'The IRS made the first two rounds of payments based on the information it had from 2018 or 2019 tax returns.  If you are eligible for a larger payment based on your 2020 information, you can claim that credit when you file your 2020 return.  For example:'
            info_last_html:
            - To claim this credit, you will need to report how much you received from the two EIPs in 2020. However, you will not have to repay the stimulus payments you received if your income went up in 2020 or the number of dependents you claimed went down.  You will need to complete <a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#idm140693714589984">the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet</a> for line 30 of the 2020 1040 tax form. We can assist you with these forms if you file your return through GetYourRefund.
            - If you have any earned income or dependents, you may be able to access additional tax credits or benefits by filing or updating your info with the IRS. Please reach out via chat for more information.
            list:
            - You only got a partial payment due to the phase out, but you lost your job due to COVID-19 and your income was lower in 2020 than in 2019.
            - You had a new baby in 2020.
            - You could be claimed as someone else’s dependent in 2019, but not in 2020.
            - You were not required to file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, and missed the deadline for using the non-filers portal to claim the payments.
          irs_info_html: The IRS will post all key information on %{irs_eip_link} as soon as it becomes available.
          last_updated: Updated on April 6, 2021
          mixed_status_eligibility:
            header: Are mixed immigration status families eligible?
            info_html:
            - Originally, mixed status families were not eligible for the first round of payments. However, now mixed status families can claim both the first and second round of payments on this year’s tax return. For the second round of payments, if you jointly file with your spouse and only one of you has a valid Social Security Number, the spouse with the valid SSN will receive up to $600 and up to $600 for any qualifying children with SSNs. However, the spouse without a valid SSN is not eligible. The same rules now apply for the first round of payments as well.
            - |-
              For the third round of payments, taxpayers who file with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) can claim the EIP for their dependents who have Social Security Numbers.  You may obtain an ITIN by filing the <a
