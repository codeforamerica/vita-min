          how_do_i_get_an_itin:
            answer_html: |
              If your children have social security number(s) but you do not, then you can use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) in order to claim the Child Tax Credit.
              <br/><br/>
              To apply for an ITIN, you must submit <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7'>Form W-7</a> to the IRS along with the required identity verification (like a passport, driver's license, or birth certificate). You can see a full list of identity verification document options listed <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw7'>here</a> under “Supporting Documentation”.
              <br/><br/>
              You can submit your W-7 and identity verification documents through the mail (using the address shown on Form W-7), in person at an <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office'>IRS office</a>, or through a <a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/acceptance-agent-program'>Certified Acceptance Agent</a>.
            question: How do I get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) if I do not have a Social Security Number?
          how_do_i_know_what_i_received_for_the_stimulus:
            answer_html: |
              In order to claim the Child Tax Credit, you will need to report the amount you may be missing in stimulus payments (Economic Impact Payments).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>first stimulus payment</b> was sent in April 2020 and was $1,200 per adult tax filer plus $500 per dependent under 17 years old (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $2,200).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>second stimulus payment</b> was sent in December 2020 and was $600 per adult tax filer plus $600 per dependent (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $1,800).
              <br/><br/>
              The <b>third stimulus payment</b> was sent in April 2021 and was $1,400 per adult tax filer plus $1,400 per dependent of any age (for example, a parent caring for two children would have received $4,200).
            question: How do I know what I received for the stimulus (Economic Impact Payments)?
          no_income_or_income_from_benefits_programs:
            answer_html: |
              There is no minimum income required to get the Child Tax Credit for tax year 2021. Even if your family has $0 in reported income and didn’t work during the previous year, you can still be eligible for the full Child Tax Credit as long as you have a child who has a Social Security Number and was younger than 17 at the end of 2020.
              <br/><br/>
              If your only income was from benefits programs, we recommend that you use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal to receive cash benefits for your family.
              <br/><br/>
              If you earned income from a benefits program and also some income from working, you have the option to file a full tax return in order to receive the additional benefits that you may qualify for.
            question: What if I don’t have any income, or only income from benefits programs (like SSI, SNAP, TANF, or WIC)?
          parents_with_shared_custody:
            answer_html: |
              If you are married and signing up for the Child Tax Credit jointly with your spouse, you will receive one monthly payment per child, as a family.
              <br/><br/>
              If you file separately from any other caretakers for your child, then only one person can sign up to receive the Child Tax Credit.
            question: Can parents who share custody of a child both get the Child Tax Credit?
          title: Common Questions
          what_will_happen_and_when:
            answer_html: |
              If the IRS thinks your family is eligible for the Child Tax Credit and already has the information it needs to pay you automatically, you should have received a postcard or letter from the IRS in June 2021.
              <br/><br/>
              If you have already filed taxes for tax years 2019 or 2020, you will begin receiving your payments automatically on July 15, 2021, and then on or about the 15th of each month for the next 6 months.
              <br/><br/>
              If you have not filed taxes in the past two years and need to submit information to claim the Child Tax Credit, you can use GetCTC, a simplified tax filing portal.
              <br/><br/>
              If you need to update your address or banking information with the IRS you can use the <strong><a rel='noopener' target='_blank' href='https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal'>CTC Update Portal (CTC UP)</a></strong> ahead of your August payment. Coming soon: at a later date, the update portal will give you the ability to update your household information.
            question: What will happen and when?
          what_will_i_need_to_submit:
            answer_html: |
              Signing up for the Child Tax Credit is simple: you only need a working email address or phone number and the social security numbers of any children you want to claim.<br/><br/>
              Children claimed for the Child Tax Credit must have a valid Social security number (SSN), however the tax filer (a parent, grandparent, or guardian) can have either a SSN or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).
            question: I don’t usually file taxes, what will I need to submit to sign up for the Child Tax Credit?
          will_i_ever_have_to_pay_this_money_back:
            answer_html: If you receive payments for a child who is no longer your dependent or if your income has drastically changed, you may have to pay that money back, though there are some protections in place for those with incomes below $80,000 (for individuals or non custodial parents), $100,000 (for single, head-of-household), or $120,000 (for filing jointly).
            question: Will I ever have to pay this money back?
          will_it_affect_my_immigration_status:
            answer_html: No, receiving the Child Tax Credit or other tax credits that you are eligible for, will not affect your immigration status, your ability to get a green card, or your future immigration plans. Use of tax credits is not considered in a “public charge” determination by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
            question: Will receiving the Child Tax Credit affect my immigration status or my ability to get a green card?

            - title: Will the EIP check affect my other government benefits?
              content_html: No, the EIP checks are treated as a tax credit. This means your payment will not impact the benefits you receive now or in the future.
            - title: I still need to file a tax return. How long are the economic impact payments available?
              content_html: These payments will continue to be available by filing a tax return. Although the official deadline is May 17, you can continue to file until October 15 via GetYourRefund.org.
            - title: If I owe taxes, or have a payment agreement with the IRS, or owe other federal or state debts, will I still get the EIP?
              content_html: While the stimulus payments made in 2020 were protected from garnishment, the same is not true for payments made through Rebate Recovery Credits.
            - title: What if I am overdrawn at my bank?
              content_html: If your bank or credit union has taken a portion of your EIP to cover money you owe them, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/consumer-advisory-protect-your-economic-payment-if-your-account-is-overdrawn/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends</a> calling them to ask if they are willing to be flexible.
            - title: What if someone offers a quicker payment?
              content_html: Don’t click on links whose origins you aren’t 100% sure of. Be wary of scams. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. And don’t send money to someone you don’t know.  Look at the fees being charged if you are paying for your tax preparation service or a refund anticipation loan by having them deducted from your refund.

        header: Get your Stimulus Check (EIP)
        intro:
          common_questions: We know there are many questions around the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) and we have some answers! We’ve broken down some common questions to help you out.
          description:
          - The federal government has begun sending out the third round of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), often called a stimulus check. In this round, individuals can receive up to $1,400 for themselves or $2,800 for a married couple filing jointly and an additional $1,400 for every dependent.
          - If you have not yet received this payment or earlier rounds of payments, it is not too late! You can still claim them by filing a tax return this year.
          eligibility:
            header: Who is eligible?
            info:
            - For the first round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples and up to $500 for each qualifying child under the age of 17.  For the second round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child.
            - In each round of payments, tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals, up to $112,500 for those filing as head of household, or up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns receive the full payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount phases down gradually.
            - In the first two rounds of payments, only children under age 17 could be claimed for the dependent payment. Other dependents were not eligible—and also could not claim the EIP themselves. In the third round of payments, all dependents, including college students and adult dependents can be claimed.  In addition, as discussed below, some children in mixed-immigration status households who were previously ineligible, can receive the third payment.
            - 'The IRS made the first two rounds of payments based on the information it had from 2018 or 2019 tax returns.  If you are eligible for a larger payment based on your 2020 information, you can claim that credit when you file your 2020 return.  For example:'
            info_last_html:
            - To claim this credit, you will need to report how much you received from the two EIPs in 2020. However, you will not have to repay the stimulus payments you received if your income went up in 2020 or the number of dependents you claimed went down.  You will need to complete <a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#idm140693714589984">the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet</a> for line 30 of the 2020 1040 tax form. We can assist you with these forms if you file your return through GetYourRefund.
            - If you have any earned income or dependents, you may be able to access additional tax credits or benefits by filing or updating your info with the IRS. Please reach out via chat for more information.
            list:
            - You only got a partial payment due to the phase out, but you lost your job due to COVID-19 and your income was lower in 2020 than in 2019.
            - You had a new baby in 2020.
