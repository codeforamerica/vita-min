          header: Help getting started
          how_long:
            a1: All in all GetYourRefund takes 5-10 business days to complete because you work one on one with a tax preparer.
            a2: The first step is to answer questions about your tax situation in our online form and upload your tax documents, which can take 10-30 minutes. Next, you will receive a call from your tax specialist in 2-3 business days to discuss your tax situation. Your tax return will then be prepared and quality reviewed by an IRS-certified tax preparer who will call you to discuss your refund and the process for electronic signature and filing. After taxes are filed we have heard from clients that they receive a direct deposit from the IRS within a week.
            q: How long will this take?
          how_to_start:
            a: To get started, go to GetYourRefund.org, click “Get Started,” and let us know that you want to “Start my taxes online.” You will have to upload photos of your ID, answer some questions about your tax situation, and upload your tax documents. Then one of our tax specialists will call you on the phone to discuss your taxes, answer any questions, and complete your filing.
            q: How do I get started?
          is_it_free:
            a: Yes! We partner with VITA, an IRS program that certifies tax experts at local community nonprofits like United Way, to complete your state and federal taxes for free.
            q: Is this service really free?
          missing_docs:
            a_html: If you have lost or never received a tax document, the first place to try is your employer. Often your employer can quickly re-issue your tax forms to you. If that doesn’t work, you can request your tax documents from the IRS at %{transcript_link}.
            q: What should I do if I can’t find a tax document?
          non_filer:
            a: We can file your taxes for 2017, 2018, and 2019. We encourage you to let us know if you haven’t yet filed for these years, because this can help you claim refunds from previous years that you may have missed out on.
            q: What should I do if I haven’t filed in several years?

              a: For those concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return, these economic impact payments will be available throughout 2020 and the 2021 tax filing season.
