Token-based client login & incomplete client login requests

- Adds a way for clients to login to a portal placeholder page using a token-based link
- clients enter their SSN last four, the ssn last four of their spouse or confirmation number (client id)
- Implements most, but not all of the process for a client to enter contact info and request a token based link
- In order to unblock other features, we moved the client login request process out of scope and skipped the incomplete tests.
