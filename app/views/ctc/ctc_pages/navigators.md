***Need help claiming your tax benefits?*** To get help claiming the Child Tax Credit, stimulus payments, Earned Income Tax Credit, and other credits, go to **[GetYourRefund.org](https://www.getyourrefund.org/en)** and click "Get Started." If you need assistance, click "Chat with us."*

Each year millions of families are eligible for thousands of dollars in tax benefits like the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, but don’t receive them because they haven’t filed a tax return. This year, more families than ever qualify for these expanded tax benefits. You can help these families by becoming a community Navigator.

Navigators don’t have to be tax experts. Navigators are trusted, community-based guides that help marginalized families access information and resources to claim their eligible benefits.

There are a number of ways you can assist families in accessing their benefits. It’s up to each organization to determine the level of support they’re able to provide and what would be most valuable to their target audience. Assistance could include:

- Building awareness about the benefits of filing a tax return
- Helping clients access services at [GetYourRefund.org](http://GetYourRefund.org) and other online tools
- Assisting clients in accessing the documents they need to file a tax return
- Providing interpretation services for non-English and Spanish speaking communities

## Outreach and Navigation Updates

*To improve transparency with our partners, we will host all future updates in this section of our navigator page with the posted date. As new updates are posted, previous notices will be available in a linked document.*

### **2022 Tax Filing Season - Posted on 2/7/2022**

The following is an update on Code for America’s plans for the 2022 filing season, as of early February 2022. Note that these plans could be subject to change based on policy changes or other outside events.

- As of January 31, [GetYourRefund.org](http://getyourrefund.org/) is open to the public. GetYourRefund currently provides three services to help clients file full tax returns:

    (1) **GetYourRefund Virtual VITA**, which allows clients to complete a virtual VITA intake and connects them to a VITA volunteer to file

    (2) **File Myself** (a.k.a. Facilitated Self-Assistance, or DIY), which allows clients to file themselves using TaxSlayer software, with chat assistance from VITA-certified volunteers, and

    (3) A **VITA site locator** that clients can use to find an in-person VITA site (where available).

    When clients arrive at GetYourRefund, they are also offered an interactive tool that helps them determine which of these services is the best fit for them.

- Simplified filing — akin to the process offered at [GetCTC.org](http://getctc.org/) last year — will be available at [GetYourRefund.org](http://getyourrefund.org/) later this year.
    - We expect to launch simplified filing in May 2022. Simplified filing is launching later in the year because: (1) The IRS regulations authorizing simplified filing do not permit simplified returns to be submitted before April 18, and (2) Simplified filing rules were released only in late January, and are somewhat more complicated than Code for America expected. It will take a few months to update, certify, and test a tool that fulfills the requirements.
    - Upon launch, simplified filing will allow households without a tax filing obligation to claim 2021 Child Tax Credit (CTC) and EIP3 payments.
    - Although the regulations authorizing simplified filing mention the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the process outlined to claim EITC is not simple; it requires filers to report their income and provide a W-2. Simplified filers using our service will *not* be able to claim EITC when simplified filing launches. We will research the possibility of adding EITC functionality later in the year.
    - At present, the simplified filing rules do *not* accommodate Puerto Rican residents who are seeking to claim CTC. The IRS and Treasury are currently working on this issue, and we hope to have an update soon.
- Code for America encourages other organizations and government agencies to assist with outreach efforts to promote tax filing tools.
    - We encourage partners who are focused on reaching traditional non-filers with no (or nearly no) earned income to wait until simplified filing is available to launch significant outreach efforts. While we do our best to provide streamlined service to GetYourRefund clients, filing a full return will likely be a significant barrier for these families, and they may have more luck waiting for the simplified tool.
    - Full details on the services available at [GetYourRefund.org](http://getyourrefund.org/) — and information on how outreach partners can get involved — are available **[here](https://codeforamerica.org/getyourrefund-outreach)**.
    - Additional research on best practices in tax benefits outreach — based on our experience offering simplified filing in 2021 — is available [**here**](https://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lessons-from-simplified-filing-in-2021-getctc-report-january-2022.pdf). Note that this research is based on simplified filing, not filing full tax returns.
    - For reference, during this tax season, Code for America will be prioritizing the following outreach strategies:
        - Following up with last year’s GetYourRefund and GetCTC clients, including testing to see when GetCTC clients are successful making it through a full return.
        - Running Google search ads, beginning when simplified filing is available.
        - Encouraging state and local benefits agencies to send outreach messages to their beneficiaries.
