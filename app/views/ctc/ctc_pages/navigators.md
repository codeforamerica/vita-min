Millions of families are eligible for thousands of dollars in Child Tax Credit and stimulus payments from the IRS, but won’t receive them because they haven’t recently filed taxes, or their information on file with the IRS is out of date. You can help these families by becoming a Navigator.

Navigators don’t have to be tax experts. Navigators are trusted, community-based guides that help marginalized families utilize IRS tools, and understand and complete the process of filing their taxes.

As a Navigator, you’ll help families:

- Figure out which forms — if any — families need to complete to get their money.
- Help families file simplified tax returns to get CTC and stimulus payments using GetCTC.org.
- Help families update their data with the IRS using the CTC Update Portal.
- Help families start the process of filing a full tax return at GetYourRefund.org.

## **1. Getting Started**

### Basic Orientation

To get started as a Navigator:

1. **Learn the essential responsibilities of a Navigator by reviewing this [guide](https://files.codeforamerica.org/2021/08/19180804/navigator-orientation.pdf).** We'll introduce you to the Navigator role, and give you the basic information you need to determine the right next steps for families, based on their tax situation.
2. **[Watch a short demo of GetCTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGoyN_M9SfQ)**. Get a quick tour of GetCTC’s simplified filing portal. The portal is mobile friendly, available in English and Spanish, and can be used as an alternative to the IRS Non-Filer Sign-Up tool. Users are only eligible for this service if their 2020 income is below a certain level — $12,400 if filing single, or $24,800 if filing married.

## **2: Going Deeper**

### Quick guides on topics of interest:

- **[Common rejects for non-filers and next steps](https://files.codeforamerica.org/2021/08/19180805/common-rejects-for-non-filers-and-next-steps.pdf)**: After filing the non-filer form, clients will receive an email letting them know if their return was accepted or rejected. This guide explains common reasons a client's return is rejected, and possible next steps.
- **[Reasons to opt-out of the Advance CTC](https://files.codeforamerica.org/2021/08/19180804/reasons-to-opt-out-of-advctc.pdf):** By default, the IRS is issuing Advance CTC payments to anyone who was eligible for CTC last year. For some families, it will be better to receive these payments as a lump sum next year, rather than receive the advance payments. This guide explains under which circumstances a family may choose to opt out of advance payments.
- **[Eligibility for CTC and stimulus payments](https://files.codeforamerica.org/2021/08/19180805/eligibility-requirements-for-ctc-and-stimulus-payments.pdf):** A detailed reference of which families are eligible for how much from each program, given their immigration status and other factors.
- **[Calculating Recovery Rebate Credit:](https://files.codeforamerica.org/2021/08/19180735/calculating-the-recovery-rebate-credit.pdf)** Clients who missed out on their full 1st or 2nd stimulus payments have the opportunity to claim the missing funds on their 2020 tax return. GetCTC walks clients through this process, but clients using the IRS non-filer tool or filing a full return need to calculate the missing amount themselves. This guide shows you how.
