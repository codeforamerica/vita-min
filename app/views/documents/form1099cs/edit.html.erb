  <strong>You might have this form</strong>
  because you said that you had debt forgiven by a lender.
  If you borrowed money from a commercial lender and at least $600 of that debt was cancelled or forgiven, they should have sent you this form.
  If you havenâ€™t received a 1099-C and believe you should have, contact your lender.
