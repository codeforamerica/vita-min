            </ul>
            <li>You want to file your federal and state tax returns using different filing statuses (for example you file as Head of Household on your federal tax return and want to file Single on your state tax return).</li>

            <li>You have additional income you are required to report on your Arizona return that was not included on your federal return (for example, interest income from a non-Arizona municipal bond). <a href="https://azdor.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/FORMS_INDIVIDUAL_2022_140BOOKLET.pdf#page=29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">See all additions on page 5 of AZ Form 140.</a></li>
            <li>You received a notice from the Arizona Department of Revenue informing you that a credit you claimed in a previous tax year is subject to "recapture" (that is, you have to pay back a portion of a previously claimed credit).</li>
