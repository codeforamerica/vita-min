    how_do_i_get_the_child_and_dependent_care_credit:
      answer_html: |
        <p>In order to claim the Child and Dependent Care credit, you must have:</p>
        <ul class="list--bulleted">
        <li>Paid for care in 2022 for a qualifying child under the age of 13, or a spouse or dependent unable to care for themselves.</li>
        <li>Needed this care in order to work or look for work yourself. In a two-parent household, both spouses must have been working or looking for work (or a full-time student).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When filing a tax return, you will need to report the amount you paid, as well as the care provider's name, Employer Identification Number (EIN), and address. If your child care was provided by an individual, you'll need their name, Social Security Number, and address.</p>

    title: Child and Dependent Care Credit
    what_is_the_child_and_dependent_care_credit:
      answer_html: |
        <p>The Child and Dependent Care Credit is a tax credit that helps families cover expenses for child care needed to work or to look for work. The credit is also available to families that must pay for the care of a spouse or other adult relative who isn't mentally or physically able to care for themselves. Families can claim up to $3,000 for one child/dependent or $6,000 for two or more children/dependents.The credit covers 20 to 35% of the cost of child care. The percentage is based on your earned income and Adjusted Gross Income (if married filing jointly your spouse must also be working to meet the requirements). You must report earned income during 2022 to claim the credit.</p>
        <p>Please note, the amounts for this credit have reverted back to their original amounts for 2022.</p>

      answer_html: |
        <p>To be eligible for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), each child claimed must have a Social Security Number (SSN) and each parent must have either a Social Security Number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN).</p>
        <p>If you do not currently have an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN), but want to claim the Child Tax Credit for your children, you can apply for an ITIN with the support of a certified tax preparer using <a href="https://www.getyourrefund.org/en/questions/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourRefund</a>.</p>

    how_do_i_claim_child_tax_credit_for_a_baby_in_2023:
      answer_html: |
        <p>You cannot claim a baby born in 2023 yet; you'll have to wait until 2024. When you file taxes, you can only include information for that tax year. Even though you are filing your 2022 taxes in 2023, you can only include income, children, marriages, etc. that occurred in 2022.</p>
        <p>When you file taxes next year, you can claim children that were born in 2023.</p>
      question: How do I claim the Child Tax Credit for a baby born in 2023?
    how_much_is_the_child_tax_credit_in_2022:
      answer_html: |
        <p>For 2022, the CTC has reverted back to it's original design as a nonrefundable tax credit - meaning it only reduces a person's tax liability by up to $2,000 per eligible child and is not paid out as a refund. A nonrefundable tax credit means it is not issued as a refund but only applied to taxes owed on that tax return.</p>
        <p>When you file your 2022 tax return, the Child Tax Credit will be on your tax return as a nonrefundable tax credit reducing your tax liability.</p>
      question: How much is the Child Tax Credit in 2022?
    i_owe_back_child_support_can_i_still_get_all:
      answer_html: |
        <p>Probably not. </p>
        <p>If you owe back child support, some payments you get from the government can be taken (or "garnished") to pay your child support debt. IRS payments like tax refunds are subject to this process.</p>
        <p>Notably, the CTC monthly payments issued in 2021 were <em>not</em> taken to cover child support debts. Any amount you claim this year, though—whether it is the second half of the credit, or the whole credit—can be taken.</p>
      question: I owe back child support, can I still get all of the Child Tax Credit?
    i_was_getting_child_tax_credit_monthly_payments_in_2021:
      answer_html: |
        <p>Monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) started in July 2021 based on a law Congress passed earlier that year, which made significant expansions to the CTC. Unfortunately, this law only applied to 2021. Because Congress did not renew the CTC expansion for 2022, there were no monthly payments last year. However, if you did not receive CTC on our 2021 tax return, you still may be eligible to claim it by filing an amendment for your 2021 return.</p>
        <p>You can file a 2021 tax return through our GetYourRefund full service.</p>
      question: I was getting Child Tax Credit monthly payments in 2021. Why didn’t I get my CTC monthly payment in 2022?
    title: Child Tax Credit
    why_did_my_spouse_and_i_get_two_different_letters:
      answer_html: Letter 6419 is a letter that the IRS sent to everyone who received monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments in 2021. The letters contain information about how much the IRS issued you in these monthly payments. If you did not file a 2021 return but you received Child Tax Credit payments in 2021, in order to claim the rest of the Child Tax Credit, you will need to report the amount the IRS paid you in advance — so this letter can be very helpful. Letter 6419 was sent in December 2021 or January 2022.

      answer_html: Notice 4883C and 5071C are letters the IRS sends if they have received a tax return for you and they are concerned it might be fraudulent. If you did submit a return, you will need to verify your identity, either online or on the phone, according to the instructions on the letter.

    what_do_i_do_if_im_audited_by_the_irs:
      answer_html: |
        <p>If you receive a refund that includes tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit and the IRS has a reason to believe you incorrectly claimed these credits, they may ask for additional information as part of an audit. Audits can also occur if someone else tries to claim your dependent.</p>
        <p>If you are audited, you will receive a letter or notice that asks you to provide additional information like proof of relationship and proof of residency of the dependent in question. The letter will include detailed instructions on what documents the IRS needs. If you need additional assistance in responding to the IRS, low-income taxpayers can seek help from the <a href="https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/about-us/low-income-taxpayer-clinics-litc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low Income Taxpayer Clinics</a> (LITC)</p>

Your filing requirement is typically determined by income, filing status, and age. If you were required to file a return in a previous year and now file a current tax return, the IRS may contact you with information about a skipped filing year.

      answer_html: In most cases, tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credits, and stimulus payments do not count as income in determining benefits eligibility. Any refunds you save do not count against any federally-funded public benefit program for 12 months after the refund is received.
      question: Will claiming these credits make me ineligible for other government benefits like SNAP, WIC, TANF, and housing assistance?
    will_i_need_to_repay_any_of_my_refund:
      answer_html: |
        <p>If the IRS determines your tax refund was incorrectly calculated, they may require you to repay the ineligible amount, plus interest. There may be additional penalties and consequences if the IRS determines that you were reckless or intentionally disregarded the rules of claiming these credits. Aren't sure if you qualify for tax credits? Chat with our tax experts.</p>
        <p>If you received CTC monthly payments incorrectly you will not need to repay any of them, even if they are wrong. This is the case, as long as you do not earn more than $55,000 single or $66,000 married.</p>

      answer_html: |
        <p>You are required to file taxes if you make more than $400 in self-employment income. You will report self-employment income when filing your tax return. This type of income may be recorded in a number of ways, but commonly on:</p>
        <ul class="list--bulleted">
        <li>Form 1099-NEC (Nonemployee Compensation)</li>
        <li>Form 1099-K (Payment Card and Third-Party Network Transaction)</li>
        <li>App dashboards and personal records (you are required to report all income that you earned, even if some of it is not listed on a tax form)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to closely track all of your income and expenses if you are self-employed because they may not be tracked by companies or individuals you work with. However, you are still required to report income and expenses obtained through self-employment on your tax return.</p>

    what_do_you_mean_by_selfemployed:
      answer_html: |
        <p>Self-employed is a broad description that many people who work now fall into. Generally, when the IRS talks about self-employment they could mean that you are an independent contractor or freelancer, you work on short-term contracts, or own your own business.</p>
        <p>You can be considered self-employed even if you haven't formally launched your own business. Common examples of self-employment work includes driving using a rideshare app like Uber and Lyft, delivering items using an app like Instacart and Doordash, pet sitting or dog walking, and childcare services.</p>

    how_do_i_get_an_itin:
      answer_html: |
        <p>To get an ITIN, you need to file Form W-7 along with your federal tax return. As part of the application, you will have to provide proof of identity, using original copies of your documents (most often a passport and birth certificate). You can either mail these documents to the IRS, or apply in person through the IRS or through a "Certified Acceptance Agent," who can examine and validate the authenticity of your documents on behalf of the IRS. It is often beneficial to apply in person so that you do not need to mail in your original documents.</p>
        <p>GetYourRefund does not currently offer support for obtaining an ITIN. Please use our VITA Location Finder to find an in-person site near you. Note that not all in-person sites can help with applying and renewing an ITIN. We recommend contacting the office directly to confirm.</p>
      question: How do I get an ITIN?
    if_i_file_my_taxes_can_ice_get_my_data:
      answer_html: |
        <p>Many people who are not authorized to live in the United States worry that filing taxes increases their exposure to the government, fearing this could ultimately result in deportation. If you already have an ITIN, then the IRS has your information, unless you moved recently. You are not increasing your exposure by renewing an ITIN or filing taxes with an ITIN.</p>
        <p>Current law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing tax return information with other agencies, with a few important exceptions. For instance, tax return information may in certain cases be shared with state agencies responsible for tax administration or with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws. The protections against the disclosure of information are set in law so they cannot be rescinded by a presidential executive order or other administrative action unless Congress changes the law.</p>
        <p>Knowing the potential risks and benefits involved, only proceed with an ITIN application or tax filing if you feel comfortable. This information does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an immigration attorney if you have any concerns.</p>

      question: Where should I mail my tax return?
    why_would_i_paper_file_my_tax_return:
      answer_html: |
        <p>We strongly recommend filing your tax return electronically whenever possible. E-filing is more reliable, and you will get your tax benefits faster. However, there are situations where the only option is to mail a paper copy of your tax return to the IRS.</p>
        <p>You must paper file if your tax return was rejected for reasons that cannot be resolved by efiling. For example, if your return was rejected because someone else claimed your child, you would have to paper file to claim that child. Similarly, if you were claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, or if you can't find an IP PIN you need, you would have to paper file. By paper filing a tax return in these instances, you are letting the IRS know that they need to investigate the issue further and you should expect to receive a follow-up letter from the IRS with next steps. For example, if you paper filed in order to claim a child that someone else had claimed, you might hear from the IRS about a process to submit evidence to support your case.</p>
        <p>Another common reason to paper file is if you are applying for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for the first time, or renewing an existing ITIN.</p>

      answer_html: |
        <p>If you live primarily in Puerto Rico and do not have income from outside the island, you generally have to file taxes with the Puerto Rico tax agency (Departamento de Hacienda de Puerto Rico) and <em>not</em> with the IRS. Some Puerto Rico residents are required to file returns with the IRS, and you should consult the rules carefully to make sure whether this applies to you.</p>
        <p>Like for tax benefits in the 50 states, if you want to claim a tax credit like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC), you will need to file a tax return to claim it, though different credits require different returns.</p>

        <p>AGI stands for Adjusted Gross Income. If you e-file your own return, you will need to provide the AGI you reported on last year's tax return as a security measure, to prove that you are who you say you are. If you filed a tax return last year, you should be able to find your AGI on Line 11 of your tax return.</p>
        <p>If you cannot find a copy of your tax return from last year, you should try to request a copy from the person, organization or software that helped you file the tax return. If you are still unable to get a copy of your tax return, you can request a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS at their Get Transcript page.</p>

    what_is_an_ip_pin_and_how_do_i_find:
      answer_html: |
        <p>An Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) is a six-digit number the IRS provides to people who have been victims of identity theft, or who opted into the IP PIN program. If the IRS has assigned you an IP PIN you are required to provide it when you e-file your tax return. The IP PIN is meant to provide an extra measure of protection against identity theft.</p>
        <p>If you have been the victim of identity theft and the IRS issued you an IP PIN—or if you signed up for the IP PIN program—a new IP PIN would arrive in the mail each year, in what the IRS calls Notice CP01A. The IRS issues a new IP PIN every year—last year's number will not work this year. If you cannot find this year's IP PIN, you can retrieve it online at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/retrieve-your-ip-pin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retrieve Your IP PIN</a>, by calling 800-908-4490, or by making an in-person appointment at your <a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center</a>.</p>

      answer_html: |
        <p>Many people who are not authorized to live in the United States worry that filing taxes increases their exposure to the government, fearing this could ultimately result in deportation. If you already have an ITIN, then the IRS has your information, unless you moved recently. You are not increasing your exposure by renewing an ITIN or filing taxes with an ITIN.</p>
        <p>Current law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing tax return information with other agencies, with a few important exceptions. For instance, tax return information may in certain cases be shared with state agencies responsible for tax administration or with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws. The protections against the disclosure of information are set in law so they cannot be rescinded by a presidential executive order or other administrative action unless Congress changes the law.</p>
        <p>Knowing the potential risks and benefits involved, only proceed with an ITIN application or tax filing if you feel comfortable. This information does not constitute legal advice. Consult with an immigration attorney if you have any concerns.</p>

      answer_html: |
        <p>After your return is accepted by the IRS electronically it typically takes 2-3 weeks to receive a direct deposit or 4-6 weeks to receive a check in the mail. However, there are a few common reasons your refund may be delayed, which include:</p>
        <ul class="list--bulleted">
        <li>Your return needs a correction for the amount of the Advance Child Tax Credit payments you reported receiving</li>
        <li>Your return needs a correction for the amount of the third stimulus payment you reported receiving</li>
        <li>This is the first time you have filed taxes in several years</li>
        <li>Your return Is affected by identity theft</li>
        <li>Includes 2019 earned income to calculate the Earned Income Tax Credit</li>
        <li>Information is incomplete or doesn't match the IRS's records</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your return meets any of those circumstances, the IRS may contact you and request additional information. These delays can take months to resolve. It is important to keep an eye out for any letters or notices from the IRS and to follow any next steps to ensure you get your refund as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>To avoid delays, make sure you double check all the information you provide when filing a tax return. When in doubt, wait to file until you have all the information you need!</p>

    what_should_i_do_if_i_was_claimed_as_a:
      answer_html: |
        <p>If someone claimed you as their dependent, first, you should determine whether they were in fact allowed to do so. Generally, if someone else (like a parent, grandparent, or guardian) pays for more than half of your living expenses and you live with them for most of the year, then you are their dependent. That means you do not qualify for most tax benefits (like the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, or stimulus payments), and you generally can not file your own tax return.</p>
        <p>If you think someone claimed you incorrectly, you can appeal—but unfortunately this process isn't easy. First, you'll have to mail a paper copy of your return to the IRS. (See 'How Do I Paper File'.) Next, the IRS will begin a process to determine whether the other person's claim was valid. This process can be difficult for you and for whoever else claimed you, as you may both have to provide documentation supporting your case.</p>

        <p>You can claim many relatives that financially rely on you for support as "dependents" on your tax return, though the rules for different relatives can be a little complicated.</p>
        <p>The most common dependent is your children. Generally speaking, the IRS allows you to claim your child if they live with you most of the year, they are not financially independent, they were under 19 on the last day of the year, and you are the family member best positioned to claim them. You can also treat your stepchildren and nephews/nieces as your children under this definition.</p>
        <p>You can in some cases claim other relatives, including aging parents, if you provide for most of their needs financially, and they earn very little themselves.</p>
        <p>Various exceptions apply to both of these definitions. Most tax preparation services (including GetYourRefund) will walk you through the definitions and make sure it is appropriate for you to claim your relatives.</p>
