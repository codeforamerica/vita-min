_**Need help claiming your tax benefits?** To get help claiming the Child Tax Credit, stimulus payments, Earned Income Tax Credit, and other credits, go to [GetCTC.org](http://GetCTC.org)* and click ‚ÄúGet Started.‚Äù If you need assistance, click "Chat with us."_

Each year millions of families are eligible for thousands of dollars in tax benefits like the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, but don‚Äôt receive them because they haven‚Äôt filed a tax return. **This year, more families than ever qualify for these expanded tax benefits.** You can help these families by becoming a community navigator.

This year nearly every family that has a child with an SSN can claim the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) - up to $3,600 per child and up to $1,800 per child for families who received monthly payments last year. **But they must file a 2021 tax return to receive their full credit, regardless of whether they filed.** For many families, using GetCTC will be their easiest option. 

**Navigators don‚Äôt have to be tax experts.** Navigators are trusted, community-based guides that help marginalized families access information and resources to claim their eligible benefits. 

There are a number of ways you can assist families in accessing their benefits. It‚Äôs up to each organization to determine the level of support they‚Äôre able to provide and what would be most valuable to their target audience. Assistance could include:

- Building awareness about the benefits of filing and trust in the resources to do so
- Helping clients access online services like [GetYourRefund.org](http://GetYourRefund.org) and [GetCTC.org](http://GetCTC.org)
- Assisting clients in understanding their next steps
- Providing interpretation services for non-English and Spanish speaking communities

**Interested in serving clients virtually?** Consider volunteering as a GetYourRefund and GetCTC screener! You‚Äôll help clients better understand our tools and what they need to successfully complete their returns through our easy-to-use online platform.

## **File Myself Resources**

Filing a full tax return can help families claim all of their eligible tax benefits but research shows outreach alone is not enough to convert non-filers to filers.

The File Myself option refers clients to free tax software to prepare their own taxes to claim all eligible federal and state credits. Additional assistance is available through chat and email.

### Outreach and Navigation Updates

*To improve transparency with our partners, we will host all future updates in this section of our navigator page with the posted date. *Previous updates can be found in* [**this document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KUsnQioSqPX4MnDYW83jqu2R8OtqAOYxLOS_kLqxQqM/edit?usp=sharing).* 

### GetCTC Relaunches May 11 - Posted on 5/9/22
    
We‚Äôre excited to share the news that our simplified filing tool **GetCTC will relaunch publicly next Wednesday, May 11**. More public announcements will be forthcoming soon, but we wanted to make sure we reached out now to give you some details on what to expect
    
Like last year, **GetCTC is available to households who aren‚Äôt required to file taxes** ‚Äî generally meaning they earn less than $12,500 single or $25,000 married, and have less than $400 in self-employment income. GetCTC allows clients to claim the CTC and Recovery Rebate Credit *only*. Because the tool is ‚Äúsimplified,‚Äù clients do not have to report income or provide tax documents. This makes the process much easier for low-income families, [as we saw last year](https://codeforamerica.org/news/getctc-simplified-filing-report-2021/). Households who still haven‚Äôt filed at this point in the year face high barriers to filing full returns, and promoting this simplified tool is the best chance we have to close the CTC coverage gap and show all this program can do for the highest-need families.
    
A couple of limitations to keep in mind:
    
1. **GetCTC clients cannot claim EITC**, since the simplified filing rules do not allow filers to claim EITC without reporting income.
2. GetCTC does **not have functionality to file state taxes**. (In the meantime, families who want to access EITC or state credits can use GetYourRefund, which is still available.)
3. **GetCTC is not currently available to Puerto Rico residents**, as per the simplified filing rules.
