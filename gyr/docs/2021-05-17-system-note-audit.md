## System Notes - What do we track?

### Summary
At a retro several weeks ago, a desire was expressed to find out which actions are being tracked in a client's notes. The reason for the interest was that we clearly weren't tracking every possible action and some useful ones might be missing from this audit trail. I, Jenny, took an action item to sync up with Nicole and Anu about what further actions / changes to a client we might want to include.

As it is now tax day, it probably won't make sense to work on this for a while, but I did go through and document our existing `SystemNotes` and thought it would be useful to keep this list somewhere until such time as we do want to revisit it.
